""We found a trend of generalized assessments rather than the individualized assessment that is required by Federal law and DoD and Military Service policies,"" Pentagon Inspector General Sean O'Donnell wrote in a memo to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin in June, according to Military.com. ""Some of the appellate decisions included documentation that demonstrated a greater consideration of facts and circumstances involved in a request.""
Thousands of service members filed for religious exemptions to the COVID-19 vaccine after it was mandated by Austin in August 2021, but only a fraction of those who made the requests were approved.
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS DEMAND ANSWERS FROM AUSTIN OVER 'BLANKET DENIAL' OF RELIGIOUS VACCINE ACCOMMODATIONS
The military mandates vaccinations and medical treatments for a variety of illnesses, including flu and smallpox. Service members can be excused from those treatments only with an approved religious exemption, but the Inspector General found the process for denying such requests for the COVID-19 vaccine revealed ""concerning"" trends.

""The volume and rate at which decisions were made to deny requests is concerning,"" the memo to Austin said. ""Assuming a 10-hour work day with no breaks or attention to other matters, the average review period was about 12 minutes for each package. Such a review period seems insufficient to process each request in an individualized manner and still perform the duties required of their position.""
A group of GOP lawmakers on Monday demanded answers from Austin on what they called ""blanket denial of religious accommodation"" in response to the memo.

""As of February 2022, the Department of the Navy had granted only a single, partial exemption to its COVID-19 vaccine mandate on religious grounds, and as of July 2022 the Department of the U.S. Army had approved just 20 of over 8,000 requests, the Department of the Air Force had approved less than 130 of over 9,000 requests, and the U.S. Marines had only approved seven of over 3,700 requests,"" said the group, which was led by Republican Reps.

80,wilx.com,https://www.wilx.com/2022/02/08/air-force-approves-9-religious-exemptions-covid-vaccine/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Air Force became the second military service to approve religious exemptions to the mandatory COVID-19 vaccine, granting requests from nine airmen to avoid the shots, officials said Tuesday.
The nine approved so far represent just a tiny fraction of the more than 6,400 requested by Air Force troops, and they come as other service members are challenging the lack of religious exemptions in court cases. The Marine Corps is the only other military service to grant any religious accommodations, allowing three so far. The Army and Navy have not approved any.
The services have come under criticism for their failure to grant religious exemptions, with members of Congress, the military and the public questioning if the review processes have been fair. All together, the services have received more than 14,000 requests for religious exemptions.
Military leaders have argued that religious exemptions to any of the many vaccines troops are required to get have been very rare over the years. Service members are required to get as many as 17 different vaccines, depending on where they deploy.
A federal judge in Texas granted a preliminary injunction last month, stopping the Navy from acting against 35 sailors for refusing on religious grounds to comply with an order to get the COVID vaccine.
Eight of the Air Force approvals came during the initial review process, and one was granted on appeal to senior Air Force leaders. So far, religious exemption requests from more than 3,200 airmen were denied, and another 3,200 are pending.
“The Department of the Air Force determined the service members’ accommodations could be supported with no impact to mission readiness,” the statement Tuesday said.
Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and military leaders have argued that the vaccine is critical to maintaining military readiness and the health of the force. And all of the services have now either discharged personnel for refusing the vaccine, or put a system in place to do so.
The Marine Corps has discharged 469, the Air Force has discharged 179 and the Navy has discharged 118, according to data released in the last week. The number include active-duty personnel and entry-level recruits who were still in boot camp. The Army has issued more than 3,000 formal letters of reprimand, and fired six soldiers, but has not discharged anyone yet.
All the military services have said the exemption decisions are based not only on the individual request, but also on its impact on the unit, its mission and readiness, and the health and safety of other troops.
Those who get an exemption and are allowed to stay in the service may, however, see an impact on their jobs.
The Navy and the Marine Corps have said unvaccinated service members are not allowed to deploy out to sea on ships, where infections can more easily spread. Those who have approved exemptions — either medical, administrative or religious — are assigned to shore duties.
At least 97% of the troops in each service have gotten at least one shot.

Air Force members seeking religious exemptions from the U.S. military’s COVID-19 vaccine mandate have provided “significant proof” that the service branch has discriminated against them, a federal appeals court ruled on Sept. 12.
A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit said in its decision that plaintiffs had to provide significant proof that the Air Force had a policy to deny all requests for religious exemptions, and all indications are that they have.
“To establish a general policy … the plaintiffs need not show that the Department rejects 100% of requests for religious exemptions. And the Department’s own statistics show that, as of May 23, 2022, it had rejected more than 99% of them,” U.S. Circuit Judge Raymond Kethledge, a George W. Bush appointee, wrote in the 11-page order.
“That the Department has granted only a comparative handful of religious exemptions, while granting thousands of medical and administrative ones, is itself at this stage of the case significant proof of discrimination.”
Kethledge was joined by Circuit Judges Eric Murphy and John K. Bush, both Trump appointees.
A U.S. district court in July blocked the mandate for thousands of Air Force members who remain unvaccinated and have had their religious exemptions denied or not acted upon. In response, the government asked for an emergency stay. When that was denied, the government went to the appeals court, arguing that the ruling was wrong.
Plaintiffs
The plaintiffs are all members who sought religious exemptions and were deemed by chaplains to hold sincere religious beliefs, although the military still rejected many of their requests. The others haven’t received final decisions but expect to be rejected, based on the treatment of like-minded airmen.
The group has said that evidence shows the military systemically denied requests for religious exemptions, denying federal law and the U.S. Constitution.
“This order by the Court of Appeals affirms that the Department of Defense and the Air Force violated religious free exercise rights of service members which is protected under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act and the First Amendment,” Mat Staver, founder and chairman of Liberty Counsel, which is representing the plaintiffs, said in a statement.
“This is a great victory for religious freedom, especially for these Air Force service members who love God and love America. These mandates will continue to crumble one by one in the courts.”
The latest ruling upholds U.S. District Court Judge Matthew McFarland’s Aug. 19 order, which rejected the military’s request for an emergency stay and extended through the duration of the legal battle the preliminary injunction against taking punitive action against the estimated more than 12,000 Air Force members who want religious exemptions.
The court did expedite the Air Force’s appeal of the class-wide preliminary injunction, directing the department to file its first brief within two weeks, plaintiffs to file within two weeks after that, and the Air Force to reply to that response within seven days. Oral arguments are scheduled for Oct. 19; a decision is expected in November.",en,‘Significant Proof’ Air Force Has Discriminated Against Troops Seeking Religious Exemptions to Vaccine Mandate: Court,RIGHT,MIXED,LOW CREDIBILITY,,TRUE

SEALs seeking the exemption would be barred from training, traveling for deployment and conducting other standard business thus making them un-deployable.
The Gateway Pundit has reported extensively on the negative impact that vaccine mandates have had on the US Military as well as the concerning use of the mandate to “intentionally purge” religious military members.
A recent TGP article detailed the grim details of the vaccine injuries faced by those in the military that were forced to receive it.
In August, Jim Hoft interviewed Lt. John Bowes on the fight against the mandate as well as the impact of the requirement on military readiness.
TRENDING: BREAKING: Dr. Fauci Will Be Deposed on November 23rd in Missouri-Louisiana Social Media Collusion Case with Gateway Pundit's Jim Hoft as Plaintiff
Lt. Bowes shared, “Yes, absolutely. And let’s dig into that for a second and talk about just pilots I think are a good example of the national security issue that we face. Right now we’re looking at a shortage of about 1900 pilots in the Air Force alone. And in 2017, the Chief of Staff of the Air Force said a shortage of 1500 pilots was a crisis, and we’ve grown that number by 400 now. And so to say that we are in a pilot crisis in terms of retention and manning and then to also discharge these pilots doesn’t seem to work out with our national security goals, especially in a time where intentions with Russia and China are rising almost daily.”
In March, the Biden administration asked the U.S. Supreme Court to reinforce its Covid-19 vaccine mandate to groups of Navy SEALs who remain unvaccinated, dishonestly claiming it “poses intolerable risks to safety and mission success.”
The Pentagon asked the Supreme Court to intervene after Judge Reed O’Connor granted a temporary injunction to a group of Navy SEALs from taking the Biden COVID vaccine mandate based on their requested religious exemptions.
“Trident Order #12” has now been quietly canceled by the US Navy.
Zero Hedge reports:
The US Navy quietly rolled back Trident Order #12, an order denying religious exemptions for covid vaccinations, a few months after an injunction was issued by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in early 2022 as part of an ongoing lawsuit brought by First Liberty Institute. The suit was initiated on behalf of 35 active-duty SEALS and three reservists seeking exemptions to the mandate due to the possibility of covid vaccines being developed using cells and tissues from aborted fetuses. This information has only become publicly available after a new filing in the case this week. Trident Order #12 made any non-compliant SEALS and other troops impossible to deploy and designated them as medically disqualified. This development runs in tandem with a growing trend among government institutions; they back away from their original draconian mandates but in a manner that reduces media exposure and avoids any admission that the mandates are unconstitutional. A communication order was circulated by the Navy on May 23 with the subject: “NSWC CLOSEOUT TO TRIDENT ORDER #12 – MANDATORY VACCINATION FOR COVID-19.” NSWC refers to the Naval Special Warfare Command: “This order rescinds reference A,” it states, referring to “Ref A” as “Trident Order #12 on COVID-19 Vaccinations.” The May 23 communication order also said Navy commands “will continue to follow guidance, as appropriate, regarding COVID-19 vaccination, accommodation requests, and mitigation measures.”

PENNSYLVANIA, USA — There is a new COVID-19 vaccine available on the market, and it looks a little different than its predecessors.
The newly-FDA-authorized Novavax vaccine uses traditional virus-blocking technology that has been used against other diseases for decades, such as Hepatitis B and tetanus.
Unlike the other COVID-19 vaccines, Novavax injects the spike protein directly into the body, rather than using mRNA technology.
Dr. John Goldman, an infectious disease expert at UPMC, said most people have gotten a similar shot.
“It's basically the same type of vaccine that you get for the flu and similar to other standard childhood vaccines,” Goldman said.
Health experts said Novavax’s COVID-19 vaccine could help address religious arguments made for exemptions.
“People that that is their specific religious objection, should feel comfortable getting this vaccine because there were no cell line—no human cell lines—used and no cell lines derived from aborted tissue,"" Goldman said. ""If that is the religious objection, this vaccine addresses that objection.”
However, legal experts said people that do ask for religious exemptions may face some complications.
“Now you don't have that reason,"" said Scott Cooper, lawyer and partner at Schmidt and Kramer, ""What's the actual reason? And what's the religion?”

150,breitbart.com,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2022/09/14/watchdog-warned-lloyd-austin-of-potential-noncompliance-as-dod-denied-religious-vaccine-exemptions/,"The Pentagon’s acting inspector general warned Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin of “potential noncompliance” when denying the religious exemption requests from service members who did not want to take the coronavirus vaccine, according to a memo obtained by Breitbart News.
The June 2, 2022, memo from Acting Inspector General Sean W. O’Donnell to Austin said the potential noncompliance by the Department of Defense was identified through complaints submitted to the DOD IG’s office.
“The Department of Defense (DOD) Hotline received dozens of complaints regarding denied religious accommodation requests from Service members. We found a trend of generalized assessments rather than the individualized assessment that is required by Federal law and DoD and Military Service policies,” O’Donnell wrote.
He added:
The denial memorandums we reviewed generally did not reflect an individualized analysis, demonstrating that the Senior Military Official considered the full range of facts and circumstances relevant to the particular religious accommodation request.
He said the volume and rate at which decisions were made to deny requests is “concerning,” finding an average of 50 denials a day processed over a 90-day period.
“Assuming a 10-hour work day with no breaks or attention to other matters, the average review period was about 12 minutes for each package. Such a review period seems insufficient to process each. request in an individualized manner and still perform the duties required of their position,” O’Donnell said.
O’Donnell cited in a footnote applicable laws and regulations, which include the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA), which prohibits the government from substantially burdening a person’s exercise of religion even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability, unless the government “demonstrates that application of the burden to the person — (1) is in furtherance of a compelling government interest; and (2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling government interest.”
He also cited DoD Instruction 1300.17, “Religious Liberty in the Military Services,” paragraph 3.2.d. , which requires that officials charged with making recommendations or taking final action on a service member’s request for accommodation of religious practices will review each request individually, considering the full range of facts and circumstances relevant to the specific request.
O’Donnell also noted that the DOD IG has recently announced an Audit of Military Departments’ Processing of Coronavirus Disease-2019 Vaccination Exemptions and Disciplinary Action for Active Duty Service Members.”
“The objective of this audit is to determine whether the Military Departments are processing exemption requests for the COVID-19 vaccination and taking disciplinary actions for active duty Service members in accordance with Federal and DoD guidance,” he added.
The memo, which was first reported by a military whistleblower who goes by the name “Terminal CWO,” is accompanied by another memo showing that it was not until three months later, on September 2, 2022, that Austin forwarded the DOD IG memo to the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness for “appropriate action.”
Austin said in his memo to the undersecretary:
Mandatory vaccination against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is necessary to protect the Force and ensure its readiness to defend the American people. Uniform standards must be applied to all requests for medical or administrative exemption in a manner consistent with the law and DoD policy, including DoD Instruction 6205.02, ‘DoD Immunization Program,’ and DoD Instruction 1300.17, ‘Religious Liberty in the Military Services.’ The DoD Office of Inspector general transmitted the attached Info Memo regarding information it received and reviewed concerning denials of religious accommodation requests from COVID-19 vaccination requirements. I am referring the Info Memo to you for appropriate action, in coordination with the Secretaries of the Military Departments and the DoD Office of General Counsel, as necessary and appropriate.
Although Austin did not say whether he was aware of the DOD IG’s stated concerns, the occurrence of blanket denials of service members’ religious accommodation requests was no secret.
Breitbart News reported as early as November 2021 that the Marine Corps was using form and language when denying Marines’ requests for religious exemptions from the vaccine mandate, despite a legal requirement to consider each request individually.
The Biden administration first ordered the vaccine mandate in August 2021, giving active duty service members roughly six months and Army reservists almost a year to be “fully-vaccinated” or face punishment including involuntary discharge. At least 7,444 service members have already been kicked out, but tens of thousands more await adjudication of their religious and medical exemption requests.
Rep. Jim Banks (R-IN), chairman of the Republican Study Committee, member of the House Armed Services Committee, and naval reservist, took note of O’Donnell’s memo.
“The Biden DoD illegally violated servicemembers’ religious liberty. No wonder recruiting is at an all time low!” he tweeted.

Eight of the requests were approved; another airman was rejected but won on appeal, according to a service news release Monday. So far, the Air Force has kicked out 142 airmen for refusing to get the vaccine.
""The Department of the Air Force determined the service members' accommodations could be supported with no impact to mission readiness,"" spokeswoman Ann Stefanek said in an emailed statement.

But Stefanek declined to say whether these service members were already on terminal leave or already on their way out of the ranks, the basis for approval in other cases elsewhere in the military.
The Marine Corps made headlines last month when it became the first military branch to grant three religious exemptions, but all three went to Marines who were functionally no longer serving.
As of Feb. 1, 96% of airmen were fully vaccinated; however, no exemptions had been announced at that time.
Yet, a document filed with a federal court on Feb. 4 noted that the branch had granted six exemptions. The remaining three were apparently granted sometime in the last week.
The filing is part of a legal case in the northern district of Florida that aims to be a class-action lawsuit and names officers and enlisted personnel from all the military branches, as well as civilian contractors.
The suit asks the federal court to strike down the vaccine mandate as illegal. The case gained attention last week when the judge issued an injunction that stopped the Navy from removing a commander and a Marine lieutenant colonel from their jobs over their refusal.
In the injunction, the judge overseeing the suit, Steven Merryday, wrote that the two officers were ""very likely to prevail on their claim that their respective branch of the military has wrongfully denied a religious exemption from COVID-19 vaccination.""
""The record creates a strong inference that the services are discriminatorily and systematically denying religious exemptions without a meaningful and fair hearing,"" the judge added.
The Marine Corps recently changed its reenlistment code for those being booted from its ranks, making it easier for vaccine refusers to reenter the service if they subsequently get vaccinated.
Similarly, the Air Force added that ""there is no pre-established reenlistment code for those separated for vaccine refusal.""
""Each case is assessed on its own merits, as is the discharge characterization,"" Stefanek said, but did not discuss whether the Air Force is mirroring the Marine Corps' policy.

In a memo dated June 2, Pentagon Inspector General Sean O’Donnell acknowledged a “concerning” trend in the number of requested religious exemptions and the subsequent mass denials, reported Military.com.

“We found a trend of generalized assessments rather than the individualized assessment that is required by federal law and DoD and military service policies,” he wrote in the memo to Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin. “Some of the appellate decisions included documentation that demonstrated a greater consideration of facts and circumstances involved in a request.”
Austin issued a mandate for all service members to receive the COVID-19 shots beginning Aug. 24, 2021, one day after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted full approval to the two-dose Pfizer/BioNTech regimen. His order meant men and women in uniform were mandated to take the shots or be discharged from service.
According to the watchdog’s findings, military officials spent just minutes reviewing exemptions requests, the vast majority of which were ultimately denied or have yet to be processed.
“The volume and rate at which decisions were made to deny requests is concerning,” wrote O’Donnell. “Assuming a 10-hour work day with no breaks or attention to other matters, the average review period was about 12 minutes for each package. Such a review period seems insufficient to process each request in an individualized manner and still perform the duties required of their position.”
For example, in the Army, the largest branch of the U.S. military, service members submitted 8,514 religious exemption requests. Of those, 1,602 were rejected, while only 24 were approved. The remainder were still pending as of Aug. 12 of this year.
The inspector general found roughly 50 denials per day in a 90-day period across all military branches.
Legal challenges against the U.S. military over its vaccination policy have been plentiful. In mid-September, the Marine Corps ordered a pause on administrative action against unvaccinated Marines. That action came after a federal judge in Florida blocked the branch in late August from discharging those who applied for religious exemptions, as CBN News reported.
One service member, Lt. Col. Scott Duncan, appeared on Fox News host Tucker Carlson’s show in January of this year explaining why he sought — and was denied — a religious exemption for the COVID-19 shots.

368,coffeeordie.com,https://coffeeordie.com/covid-vaccine-religious-exemption/,"The military will have to wait at least another week if it wants to punish two officers who have resisted a militarywide COVID-19 vaccine mandate on religious grounds, a federal judge ruled Thursday, Feb. 10, extending a protective order over their careers.
Both senior officers — a Marine lieutenant colonel and a Navy commander — were scheduled to be disciplined last week, but Judge Steven Merryday of the US District Court for the Middle District of Florida issued a week of injunctive relief to both, indicating that the service members were “very likely” to prevail in a pending lawsuit in which they are challenging the process by which the military is deciding religious exemptions for the vaccine mandate.
Following a nearly nine-hour hearing on Thursday, Merryday extended that order until Friday, Feb. 18.
Both plaintiffs testified anonymously in the hearing regarding their vaccine refusals, each describing themselves as devout Christians.
“For me, it would be a sin,” said the Marine, who serves as a diversity and inclusion officer with the Marine Forces Special Operations Command, according to the Tampa Bay Times. “Because it would defile my body. Because my body is a temple of Jesus Christ.”
The lieutenant colonel said she was held back from a scheduled deployment to Bahrain after refusing to take the vaccine. In January, she tested positive for COVID-19.
A Marine Corps diversity officer and a Navy commander both argue they shouldn’t be forced to take the COVID-19 vaccine, citing deeply held religious beliefs. A federal judge agreed, granting them a temporary restraining order until Feb. 18, 2022. US Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 1st Class Hana’lei Shimana.
The Navy officer is the commanding officer of a guided-missile destroyer.
“My body is a temple,” the commander testified. “I cannot knowingly put something in my body that I believe is a toxin.”
The Navy officer, who has served in the military for about 18 years, said he submitted his religious exemption request in September but was denied, as were all 16 sailors aboard his ship who made similar requests.
The two officers are now represented by Liberty Counsel, a law firm that focuses on religious liberty cases. Both defendants said they objected to vaccines created from aborted fetal stem cell lines in their exemption requests.
Merryday noted during the hearing that it was not his job to determine whether a person’s religious beliefs were valid. But in his order last week, Merryday warned the military that the case appeared to present “a strong inference that the services are discriminatorily and systematically denying religious exemptions without a meaningful and fair hearing.”
By any measure, all four services have granted vanishingly few religious exemptions to the COVID-19 vaccine mandate, despite a crush of applications that Liberty Counsel puts at 24,818. In press releases and court documents made public this month, the total of approved exemptions appears to be fewer than 15.
A sailor receives the COVID-19 vaccine at Naval Base San Diego, Jan. 22, 2021. US Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist Seaman Luke Cunningham.
As of Wednesday, the Navy has granted no waivers for any of the 3,348 active-duty requests for religious exemptions, according to the Navy.
The Air Force released numbers Tuesday afternoon showing that the service had granted a total of nine religious exemptions — eight directly and one after an appeal — against 3,222 disapproved requests and 443 disapproved appeals, with about 3,300 more requests and appeals pending. Those nine approvals were the first reported by the service since its Nov. 2, 2021, vaccine deadline.
According to a Feb. 3 Marine Corps press release, of 3,458 requests, the Marines have granted just three religious exemptions.
The Army does not publish its exemption numbers, but according to Feb. 4 court filings in a separate lawsuit, the Army has not granted any exemptions from 3,253 requests, and it has denied 391.
In all, the success rate of religious exemption requests across the military appears to be well below 1%.
In Thursday’s hearing, Department of Justice attorney Amy Powell said the government’s position was simple: Service members must get vaccinated or face disciplinary action.

“We would rather people not be in the military than place other service members at risk,” Powell said, according to the Tampa Bay Times.
However, the military is unlikely to prove that allowing the “relatively small” number of requested religious exemptions would impact the readiness of the nation’s military forces, Merryday wrote.
“In fact, the public undoubtedly has some considerable interest in maintaining the services of skilled, experienced, highly trained, patriotic, courageous, and esteemed service members, such as the two moving service members, in whom the public has an immense financial investment and who are not, to say the least, readily replaceable,” he added.
While this temporary stay only protects the two plaintiffs, Liberty Counsel hopes to expand the case into a class-action suit that could apply to all military members.

Information made available Tuesday is that the Air Force granted eight religious accommodations and one religious accommodation appeal, making the total nine, Air Force spokesperson Ann Stefanek told the Daly Caller News (DCNF) Foundation.
Records show that a total of 5,786 airmen have submitted religious accommodation requests, since the Air Force issued a mandate in Early September of 2021. That decision followed a Department of Defense announcement in August of 2021 that all service members would be mandated to get the vaccination. The Air Force has rejected 3,665 exemption requests.
Stefanek said in a statement, “The Department of the Air Force determined the service members’ accommodations could be supported with no impact to mission readiness.” The Air Force has administratively separated 142 active-duty Airmen, as of February 7, Stefanek told the DCNF.
The Marine Corps made headlines when it became the first military branch to grant three religious exemptions last month. However, according to a letter sent to Representative Darrel Issa (R-CA), all three went to Marines who were,functionally, no longer serving.
In a letter dated January 21, J.J. Daily, the deputy legislative assistance in the Marines Corps’ Office of Legislative Affairs, wrote that “In two cases, the Marines are on terminal leave and in the other the Marine has transitioned into a 180-day training program in private industry.”
“The likelihood of their vaccination status impacting military readiness and health and safety was remote because the requestors are no longer serving with Marine Corps commands,” Daily wrote.
In the weeks since the military began separating troops for failing to comply with its COVID-19 vaccine mandate, the Marine Corps has consistently been the most aggressive branch, having removed 399 from the service.
Meanwhile, the Marine Corps quietly made a subtle change to how it deals with vaccine refusing service members, making it easier for them to return.
In late December, the Corps released a message announcing it would discharge Marines with the reentry code RE-3P instead of RE-4. The distinction is significant. A discharge with a RE-4 code is typically a bar on reenlisting in any service, while the RE-3 code allows someone to reenlist with a waiver.
When asked about the change, Captain Ryan Bruce, a spokesman for the Marine Corps said, “If a Marine is willing to be vaccinated, even after separation, we would welcome him back.”
Bruce added, “the adjusted reentry code reduces the administrative burden and timeliness of that process.”
The Air Force is apparently less rigid in its separation policy. Stefanek told Military.Com in an email that “there is no pre-established reenlistment code for those separated for vaccine refusal. Each case is assessed on its own merits as is the discharge characterization.”

Pentagon in ‘Potential Noncompliance’ With Law in Denying Religious Exemption Requests to Vaccine Mandate: Leaked Memo
The Department of Defense (DOD) has been in “potential noncompliance” with standards for reviewing and communicating denials of religious accommodation requests to the vaccine mandate, the Pentagon’s watchdog wrote to the secretary of defense in a June memo obtained by The Epoch Times.
The June 2 memo by Acting Inspector General (IG) Sean W. O’Donnell states that after reviewing dozens of complaints from service members who were denied religious accommodation, the IG’s office “found a trend of generalized assessments rather than the individualized assessment that is required by Federal law and DoD and Military Service policies.”
The purpose of the memo was to inform the secretary of defense of “potential noncompliance with standards for reviewing and documenting the denial of religious accommodation requests of Service members identified through complaints submitted to the [IG’s] office.”
“The denial memorandums we reviewed generally did not reflect an individualized analysis, demonstrating that the Senior Military Official considered the full range of facts and circumstances relevant to the particular religious accommodation request,” the memo reads.
It provided an example of such cursory treatment. An Air Force general used a one-sentence statement to deny an airman’s request: “I disapprove your request for exemption from vaccinations under the provisions of AFI 48-110, paragraph 2-6.b.3.”
The acting IG also noted that the volume and rate of denial decisions were “concerning.”
An average of 50 denials per day were processed over a 90-day period, according to the memo.
“Assuming a 10-hour work day with no breaks or attention to other matters, the average review period was about 12 minutes for each package,” it reads. “Such a review period seems insufficient to process each request in an individualized manner and still perform the duties required for their position.”
The acting IG drew attention to DOD Instruction 1300.17, titled Religious Liberty in the Military Services. Paragraph 3.2.d, which was extracted in a footnote of the memo, states that “officials charged with making recommendations or taking final action on a Service member’s request for the accommodation of religious practices will review each request individually, considering the full range of facts and circumstances relevant to the specific request . … The means that is least restrictive to the requestor’s religious practice and that does not impede a compelling governmental interest will be determinative.”
The memo was received by Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin who, in a Sept. 2 memo that was also obtained by The Epoch Times, referred the matter to the undersecretary of defense for personnel and readiness “for appropriate action, in coordination with the Secretaries of the Military Departments and the DoD Office of General Counsel, as necessary and appropriate.”
“Uniform standards must be applied to all requests for medical or administrative exemption in a manner consistent with law and DoD policy, including DoD Instruction 6205.02, ‘DoD Immunization Program,’ and DoD Instruction 1300.17, ‘Religious Liberty in the Military Services,’” reads the Sept. 2 memo signed by Austin, a Biden appointee.
When contacted by The Epoch Times about the June memo, a spokesperson for the IG’s Office said via email, “The memorandum in question is Controlled Unclassified Information and will not be released at this time.”
The spokesperson didn’t dispute the authenticity of the document.
To date, the combined services have separated at least 7,476 service members over the vaccine mandate, according to the most recent publicly released figures.
As of July 11, the Air Force had approved 104 religious exemptions and administratively separated 834 service members for refusing the vaccine mandate. As of Sep. 8, the Marine Corps had approved (pdf) 14 religious exemptions and separated 3,436 service members. As of Aug. 24, the Navy had approved 46 religious exemptions and separated 1,533 people. As of Sept. 1, the Army had approved 32 religious exemptions, with 1,673 separations.
‘Unethical Behavior’
Army Chief Warrant Officer Danny Erickson (a pseudonym) discovered the IG memo through a fellow member of the military last week and posted extracts of the memo on his personal website that he created to be a voice for service members who continue to battle against the military’s vaccine mandate.
Erickson, an active-duty service member for more than 20 years and a whistleblower, spoke to The Epoch Times using a pseudonym because of a fear of reprisal.
The officer’s website provides more than two dozen examples of Air Force and Navy religious accommodation request denial letters sent to service members.
“Air Force denials are almost identical, while Navy denials are an exact match,” he said. “For the last year, I’ve seen hundreds of other letters with striking similarities.
“These identical letters expose a level of corruption or unethical behavior within chains of command and leadership.
“They are clearly not looking at individual cases considering the full range of facts and circumstances relevant to specific requests for religious accommodation. They are blanket denying any religious accommodations, and it’s happening at the highest levels.
“The DOD has flat out, undeniably, broken the law concerning religious liberty, and the [secretary of defense] is fully aware of it, because of the memo dated June 2.”
What’s more, the secretary has done nothing to address the acting IG’s warning, Erickson alleged.
A Common Theme Warrants Investigation
The Epoch Times also spoke to Navy Commander Robert A. Green Jr., who was relieved from his position as an executive officer of one of the seven Maritime Expeditionary Security Squadrons within Navy Expeditionary Combat Command on Jan. 7.
“I provided evidence that the Navy was violating federal law and military regulation in how they adjudicated the standardized pre-determined denials of religious accommodation requests,” Green said.
He was relieved of his duties as an executive officer only four days after this evidence was used as the basis for a preliminary injunction granted to Navy SEALs by a federal court.
“In December 2021, I filed an internal Navy complaint against Vice Admiral John Nowell who was the chief of naval personnel and the person designated by the Navy to adjudicate all religious accommodation requests for COVID-19 products,” Green said.
His complaint pointed to Nowell’s utilization of a standard operating procedure that “streamlined the process” that his staff would take to deny all religious accommodation requests. Green noted that “one of the very first steps in the process, once they received a request, was to paste the requestor’s name into the denial template and then route the denial for review.”
“It wasn’t until one of the last steps of the process, that a staffer was finally directed to actually open the request,” he said.
Green’s complaint was formally dismissed in August. A letter from the Office of the Naval Inspector General states that his complaint was “reviewed and evaluated” and determined to “not warrant an investigation” due to insufficient evidence.
“This is shocking because the Navy’s response came two months after the [IG’s] memo to the secretary of defense,” he said. “Claiming that they could find no evidence should have been impossible, considering a higher-level inspector general had already found that blanket denials of religious accommodations were being given to service members.
“Even Judge O’Connor from the Navy SEAL case in the [District Court for the] Northern District of Texas noted the evidence in his ruling granting a classwide injunction for the Navy.”
In that March ruling, U.S. District Judge Reed O’Connor, a George W. Bush appointee, said that “the evidence overwhelmingly indicates that class members’ [religious accommodation] requests and appeals will be summarily denied with ‘boilerplate’ language and ‘simplistic’ analysis.”
Both Erickson and Green allege that the DOD has violated federal regulations of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 and DOD Instruction 1300.17 with the ongoing use of “blanket denials” of religious accommodations.
“Congress should be compelled to investigate these crimes immediately,” Erickson said. “The [IG’s] memo to the [secretary of defense] cannot be ignored.”
Erickson and Green emphasized that their views don’t reflect those of the Department of Defense, the Department of the Army, or the Department of the Navy.
DOD officials and the Office of the Naval Inspector General didn’t respond to requests for comment.

718,washingtontimes.com,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2022/sep/16/dod-fast-tracked-vaccine-religious-exemption-reque/,"American military leaders may have violated federal law in apparent rapid-fire denials of religious exemptions to the Defense Department’s COVID-19 vaccination mandate, a national religious civil liberties law firm said late Friday.
Memos obtained by Liberty Counsel written by acting DOD Inspector General Sean O’Donnell said the official warned Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin of “deliberate violation[s] of federal law” within the agency over the way denial requests were processed and turndowns were issued, the group said.
Of court-ordered reports from each branch of the armed forces on Feb. 4, 2022 — apparently the latest date for which figures are available — the group reported that “out of 24,818 religious exemption requests received, only four were granted,” as opposed to 4,146 medical exemptions given.
The contentious issue of religious exemptions to vaccine mandates has rippled through the military. In May, four cadets at the Air Force Academy were threatened with expulsion and lawsuits to recover six-figure tuition costs should they not get the mandated shots before graduation.
In a June 2, 2022 memo, Mr. O’Donnell told Mr. Austin the DOD may not have complied “with standards for reviewing and documenting the denial of religious accommodation requests” for the exemptions.
“The denial memorandums we reviewed generally did not reflect an individualized analysis, demonstrating that the Senior Military Official considered the full range of facts and circumstances relevant to the particular religious accommodation request,” Mr. O’Donnell wrote. “For example, an Air Force general denied one Airman’s request with the brief statement: ‘I disapprove your request for exemption from vaccination under the provisions of AFI 48-110, paragraph 2-6.b.3.’”
Liberty Counsel’s statement said denial letters issued to Air Force and Navy servicemembers showed “similar, if not identical, wording.”
The repetitive approach, the law firm said, appears to contradict official DOD instructions on religious liberty in the military services. Those instructions require “officials charged with making recommendations or taking final action on a Service member’s request for the accommodation of religious practices will review each request individually, considering the full range of facts and circumstances relevant to the specific request.”
Mr. O’Donnell also said the speed with which exemptions were reviewed and denied was “concerning,” given the mandate to examine each application packet carefully.
“The appeal authorities of the Services we reviewed indicated that an average of 50 denials per day were processed over a 90-day period. Assuming a 10-hour work day with no breaks or attention to other matters, the average review period was about 12 minutes for each package. Such a review period seems insufficient to process each request in an individualized manner and still perform the duties required of their position,” Mr. O’Donnell wrote.
In a statement, Mat Staver, founder and chairman of Liberty Counsel, said, “The Biden administration and the Department of Defense are violating federal law by denying the religious free exercise rights of service members from the COVID shot mandate. … Their oath to defend the Constitution and their willingness to give their lives for our freedom must not be illusory. The abuse must end.”
Responding to a request for comment, Cmdr. Nicole Schwegman, a Department of Defense spokesperson told The Washington Times, “It would be inappropriate to provide comment on an internal working document.”

752,americanmilitarynews.com,https://americanmilitarynews.com/2022/02/judge-in-fl-grants-2-military-officers-religious-exemption-from-vaccine/,"A federal judge has ruled that a Navy commander and a Marine lieutenant colonel who have refused the COVID-19 vaccination on religious grounds can continue serving for now, saying the military has failed to show a compelling government interest in denying the exemptions.
The 48-page ruling was issued in Tampa on Friday by U.S. District Judge Steven Merryday in a lawsuit brought against defendants including Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin.
The pair have been identified only by rank and testified anonymously, with the judge’s consent, in Tampa earlier this month. They described themselves as practicing Christians who believe vaccines would introduce impurities into their bodies. Each also expressed concern about fetal cell lines, used in the research and development of various vaccines and many common medicines.
The military denied them a religious exemption to its service-wide vaccine requirement. They could face discharge if they don’t comply.
Merryday said the Religious Freedom Restoration Act requires that the military grant a religious exemption to any service member harboring a sincerely held religious objection to COVID-19 vaccination unless there is a compelling governmental interest and no less-restrictive alternative is available.
The Navy and the Marine Corps “have failed manifestly” to meet the requirement, the judge wrote. He issued an injunction allowing them to continue serving without “any punitive or retaliatory measure” pending a final judgment in the case.
Merryday had issued a temporary injunction earlier, barring the military from disciplining the pair through last Friday. He noted in his followup ruling Friday that the officers’ likelihood of ultimately prevailing in the lawsuit is a requirement in granting the injunction.
The Navy commander leads some 320 sailors aboard a guided-missile destroyer based in Norfolk, Va. The lieutenant colonel serves as a logistics officer at Marine Forces Special Operations Command at Camp Lejeune, N.C.
The lawsuit was brought by the Liberty Counsel, a religious organization that has fought against the military’s mandate.
In their arguments, the two officers presented the vaccination alternatives required under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, Merryday said, including the natural presence of COVID-19 antibodies as well as masking, social distancing, and isolation — all measures “that the Navy and the Marine Corps successfully implemented for more than a year before the development of vaccines.”
“The Navy commander refuses vaccination to remain true to his faith, which requires the preservation of his body as a temple of the Holy Spirit,” the judge said. The lieutenant colonel “voices a sincere objection to ‘any substance . . . connected with aborted fetal cell lines.’ In practicing her religious belief, (she) finds her opposition to abortion irreconcilable with accepting any COVID-19 vaccine.”
Merryday takes issue with the military’s contention that the proposed alternatives “are less effective than vaccination” and “must be implemented in conjunction with immunization,” saying it cannot identify any “‘100 percent’ effective method to defeat COVID-19.”

938,wtop.com,https://wtop.com/coronavirus/2022/02/air-force-approves-9-religious-exemptions-for-covid-vaccine/,"The Air Force became the second military service to approve religious exemptions to the mandatory COVID-19 vaccine, granting requests from nine airmen to avoid the shots, officials said Tuesday.
WASHINGTON (AP) — The Air Force became the second military service to approve religious exemptions to the mandatory COVID-19 vaccine, granting requests from nine airmen to avoid the shots, officials said Tuesday.
The nine approved so far represent just a tiny fraction of the more than 6,400 requested by Air Force troops, and they come as other service members are challenging the lack of religious exemptions in court cases. The Marine Corps is the only other military service to grant any religious accommodations, allowing three so far. The Army and Navy have not approved any.
The services have come under criticism for their failure to grant religious exemptions, with members of Congress, the military and the public questioning if the review processes have been fair. All together, the services have received more than 14,000 requests for religious exemptions.
Military leaders have argued that religious exemptions to any of the many vaccines troops are required to get have been very rare over the years. Service members are required to get as many as 17 different vaccines, depending on where they deploy.
A federal judge in Texas granted a preliminary injunction last month, stopping the Navy from acting against 35 sailors for refusing on religious grounds to comply with an order to get the COVID vaccine.
Eight of the Air Force approvals came during the initial review process, and one was granted on appeal to senior Air Force leaders. So far, religious exemption requests from more than 3,200 airmen were denied, and another 3,200 are pending.
“The Department of the Air Force determined the service members’ accommodations could be supported with no impact to mission readiness,” the statement Tuesday said.
Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and military leaders have argued that the vaccine is critical to maintaining military readiness and the health of the force. And all of the services have now either discharged personnel for refusing the vaccine, or put a system in place to do so.
The Marine Corps has discharged 469, the Air Force has discharged 179 and the Navy has discharged 118, according to data released in the last week. The number include active-duty personnel and entry-level recruits who were still in boot camp. The Army has issued more than 3,000 formal letters of reprimand, and fired six soldiers, but has not discharged anyone yet.
All the military services have said the exemption decisions are based not only on the individual request, but also on its impact on the unit, its mission and readiness, and the health and safety of other troops.
Those who get an exemption and are allowed to stay in the service may, however, see an impact on their jobs.
The Navy and the Marine Corps have said unvaccinated service members are not allowed to deploy out to sea on ships, where infections can more easily spread. Those who have approved exemptions — either medical, administrative or religious — are assigned to shore duties.
At least 97% of the troops in each service have gotten at least one shot.

958,military.com,https://www.military.com/daily-news/2022/02/02/3-religious-exemptions-granted-military-went-marines-their-way-out.html,"The Marine Corps made headlines when it became the first military branch to grant three religious exemptions last month. However, according to a letter sent to Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., all three went to Marines who were, functionally, no longer serving.
In a letter dated Jan. 21, J. J. Daly, the deputy legislative assistant in the Marine Corps' Office of Legislative Affairs, wrote that ""in two cases, the Marines are on terminal leave and in the other the Marine has transitioned into ... a 180-day training program in private industry.""
""The likelihood of their vaccination status impacting military readiness and health and safety was remote because the requestors are no longer serving with Marine Corps commands,"" Daly wrote.

The letter, released by Issa's office, comes after months of weekly updates from the military branches on their progress processing the thousands of filed religious exemption requests which, until the three from the Marine Corps, had resulted in no approvals. This led many vaccine refusers and their allies to allege the process was merely a formality.
A spokesman for Issa, Jonathan Wilcox, told Military.com in a phone interview that the review process is ""contradictory"" and argued that the Corps is not ""reviewing these [exemption requests] independently and only on the facts"" by noting that the letter said the three Marines' status in the Corps played a role in the decision.
Daly's letter explained that ""the crux of the decision in the many denials and the few approvals has been the Marine Corps' compelling interest in readiness, and the health and safety of the force.""
Wilcox argued that the letter shows that the trick to getting a religious exemption in the MarineCorps is ""don't be an active-duty Marine.""
Although the Marine Corps has been fairly tight-lipped about the impact COVID-19 is having on the force, generally releasing only force-wide infection totals, its fellow maritime service, the Navy, recently revealed that the danger from the pandemic continues to be ever-present and noted that the mandate has been key in keeping outbreaks on ships from having major operational impacts.
""When you weigh [the cost of retraining a new sailor] with the operational cost of having to tie up a ship due to, you know, medevac or whatever, it dwarfs it,"" Vice Adm. Bill Merz, the Navy's operations and strategy boss, told reporters last week when asked broadly about the costs of the service's COVID-19 policies.
""We have become very consistent at sea again, and I would tell you, if I had to put a dollar value on it, it's probably lower than it was a year ago because of the ability to be able to manage [COVID-19] at sea [and] return to normal operations,"" Merz added.
According to Wilcox, who says his office has spoken with ""hundreds"" of impacted military members, they are ""hearing that this process is a sham review process ... and that the word is out: 'Nobody's getting those accommodations.'""
These concerns prompted Issa to contact Gen. David Berger, commandant of the Marine Corps, through a letter sent Jan. 17 asking for more information about the exemptions and the process.
The response letter from Daly confirmed their suspicions, Wilcox said.
One of the main points that many who have resisted getting the vaccine have raised as evidence of the pro-forma nature of the review has been what they say are nearly identical and superficial rejection letters to their requests.
In his letter, Daly admits that he is aware of the ""dissatisfaction"" from Marines that their letters were ""not individually tailored to their request"" but assured Issa that each request is reviewed by a review board, a legal adviser and a chaplain before heading to the deputy commandant for Manpower and Reserve Affairs for a decision.
A spokesman for the Marine Corps, Maj. Jim Stenger, also noted in an email to Military.com that ""at every step, each accommodation request is given full consideration"" but ""every reviewer weighs the compelling government interest against the individual's request and the circumstances of their situation.""
Daly goes on to say in his letter that he was ""not aware of any case in which the adjudication authority has questioned the sincerity of a service member's belief.” But he noted that ""this is a decision that requires consideration of factors that fall outside the expertise of a trained chaplain.""
Issa's office has been seeking a pause of the vaccine mandate -- an effort that Wilcox says ""was only strengthened by this letter."" Issa and 14 other House Republicans separately sent a letter to the House Appropriations Committee on Wednesday demanding that funding to implement the mandate be blocked in any upcoming spending bill -- an unlikely prospect with Democrats in control of the House.
""I think the case for it, from our perspective, is stronger than ever,"" Wilcox said.
Editor's Note: This story has been updated, removing a reference to Gen. David Berger sending a separate response to Rep. Issa. The Marine Corps clarified that its statement referred to Daly's letter.

967,justthenews.com,https://justthenews.com/politics-policy/coronavirus/covid-mandates-end-across-us-military-lags-behind-continues-vax,"As COVID-19 mask and vaccine mandates are rescinded across the U.S. — whether under court order or in acquiescence to changing political winds — the Pentagon is counting on a combination of litigation and administrative evasion to maintain its policy of forcing COVID vaccination on religious objectors in the military.
Even New York and some Michigan schools are lifting their mask mandates, while Washington, D.C. is keeping theirs for schools while ending the vaccine and indoor mask mandates. But the Air National Guard is still looking for a way to enforce its COVID vaccine mandate against those filing ""religious accommodation requests"" (RARs) in pursuit of exemptions.
In an email sent Tuesday to state and wing JAGs, Brig. Gen. Sue Ellen Schuerman (assistant to the general counsel, National Guard Bureau-Air, Washington, D.C.) said the court decision in Air Force Officer v. Austin et al ""reiterated the need for individualized assessment of RAR requests.""
In that February ruling in favor of an officer whose RAR was denied, the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Georgia granted the first preliminary injunction against the Air Force's vaccine mandate.
Schuerman claimed in her email that in order to provide individualized assessments of religious accommodation requests, a new template is to be used ""for providing the facts and analytical discussion needed to give each request appropriate consideration.""
However, previous RARs that do not already contain this template ""will not be returned to states for revisions"" but should simply have it added to the RAR packages. This means that decisions made on RARs will not receive additional, more individualized review but simply have the new template attached to them, justifying the prior denials.
The Air National Guard was unable to respond to a request for comment by publishing time.
Military religious freedom attorney Davis Younts told Just the News on Wednesday he found it ""frustrating as an Air Force Reservist and a JAG that the Air National Guard's answer to litigation isn't to send the packages back and do it right,"" but to simply add more information for the denial instead of providing a fresh review.
The Air National Guard's decision to continue with alleged blanket denials of RARs comes as the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals on Monday denied the federal government's motion for a partial stay of the preliminary injunction pending appeal in Navy SEALs 1-26, v. Biden.
The Biden administration sought a partial stay of the preliminary injunction, which prevented the Defense Department ""from enforcing certain COVID-19 vaccination requirements against 35 Navy special warfare personnel and prohibited any adverse actions based on their religious accommodation requests,"" according to the appeals court's decision.
The government argued that ""the injunction precludes them from considering Plaintiffs' vaccination statuses 'in making deployment, assignment and other operational decisions,'"" the court noted.
In denying the government's request, the appeals court found: ""The Navy has granted hundreds of medical exemptions from vaccination requirements, allowing those service members to seek medical waivers and become deployable. But it has not accommodated any religious objection to any vaccine in seven years, preventing those seeking such accommodations from even being considered for medical waivers.""
The Defense Department also sought to stay a preliminary injunction in Navy SEAL 1 v. Austin. In that case, Judge Steven Merryday of the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida in Tampa had enjoined the military from taking ""any adverse action against two Liberty Counsel plaintiffs, a Navy warship commander and a Marine lieutenant colonel, because of their refusal to take COVID-19 shots based on religious beliefs,"" according to Liberty Counsel press release.
On Tuesday, Merryday denied the Pentagon's request to stay the preliminary injunction, scolding the government's use of the term ""refusers"" in its motion when referring to the service members seeking religious exemptions.
""The term 'refusers' is a tellingly offensive term that the defendants must employ no further in this court. A RFRA claimant is not a 'refuser,' not an outcast subject to shunning,"" Merryday wrote.
""A review of the defendants' motion reveals that the defendants persistently and resolutely cling to the belief that their accustomed and unfettered command discretion need not yield — on the narrow and specific question of the free exercise of religion — to the statutory command of RFRA or to an order under RFRA from a district court (actually, at this moment, orders from several district courts and a circuit court of appeals), the forum selected by Congress and enacted in RFRA to resolve a dispute under RFRA (in other words, Congress and the President, not the district court, chose the district court as the proper forum for service members to assert the RFRA claim asserted in this action),"" the judge noted.",en,"As COVID mandates end across U.S., lagging military still denying vaccine religious exemptions",RIGHT,MIXED,LOW CREDIBILITY,,TRUE
1058,dailycitizen.focusonthefamily.com,https://dailycitizen.focusonthefamily.com/air-force-grants-nine-religious-exemptions-from-covid-19-vaccines/,"The United States Air Force has approved nine requests by airmen for exemptions from the military’s COVID-19 vaccine mandate. These are the first requests the Air Force has approved since the mandate was issued at the end of August.
While its good news that the Air Force seems to have started taking their service members’ religious convictions seriously, the nine approved exemptions are just a drop in the bucket compared to the number of requests that have been submitted.
ABC News notes that in the Air Force alone, over 6,400 airmen have requested a religious exemption from the COVID-19 vaccine mandate. Nine approved requests out of 6,400 means that the Air Force has approved just 00.14% of them.
And across all service branches, more than 14,000 military members have submitted such requests.
The Marine Corps is the only other branch of the U.S. Armed Forces to approve requests for religious accommodation, and the Corps hasn’t been too generous either. Only three exemption requests have been approved by the Marine Corps, bringing the total approved requests across all branches to just 12.
Neither the Army nor Navy have approved any of their service members requests for religious accommodation from the vaccine mandate.
The mandate has cost hundreds of servicemembers their jobs in the Armed Forces. “The Marine Corps has discharged 469 [troops], the Air Force has discharged 179 and the Navy has discharged 118,” according to ABC News.
“The Department of the Air Force determined the service members’ accommodations could be supported with no impact to mission readiness,” the Air Force said in a statement released Tuesday.
It’s unclear why these nine servicemembers were able to get their requests approved, but the 179 who have been discharged from the Air Force were not.
In the same vein, The Daily Citizen has covered an ongoing legal battle between 35 Navy SEALS and the U.S. Navy over their requests for religious accommodations from the military’s mandate.
Last month, a federal judge issued an injunction preventing the Navy from punishing the 35 SEALs while their lawsuit against the Navy plays out.
The judge was none too kind in his assessment of the Navy’s process for considering religious exemptions from the mandate, calling the accommodations process “theater.”
“The Navy has not granted a religious exemption to any vaccine in recent memory. It merely rubber stamps each denial. The Navy servicemembers in this case seek to vindicate the very freedoms they have sacrificed so much to protect,” the judge penned.
While it’s good to laud the Air Force for approving nine airmen’s religious accommodations requests, there are still some 14,000 servicemembers whose religious convictions have been tossed aside.
These servicemembers, who sacrifice so much to protect our nation, deserve far more than a theatrical, dismissive process when it comes to the protection of their religious beliefs.

(KSLA) - A lawsuit has been filed in federal court on behalf of a senior airman at Barksdale Air Force Base against the Defense Department claiming the military’s COVID-19 vaccine mandate violates her religious beliefs.
Faith Crocker, 21, is an aircraft ordnance system mechanic with the 307th Aircraft Maintenance Squadron. She’s in the Air Force Reserve, currently ordered to extended active duty at Barksdale.
Crocker is the “daughter of a Baptist pastor” and has served for three years. She’s from Atlanta, Texas.
BAFB senior airman sues Dept. of Defense over vaccine mandate A senior airman at Barksdale Air Force Base is suing the Defense Department because she claims they denied her religious exemption to the vaccine mandate >>> https://www.ksla.com/2022/03/21/senior-airman-bafb-suing-dept-defense-over-denial-religious-exemption-vaccine-mandate/ Posted by KSLA News 12 on Monday, March 21, 2022
According to the lawsuit, which The Pelican Institute filed on the airman’s behalf Monday, March 21 in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Louisiana, Crocker submitted a religious accommodation request in October 2021. The request was ultimately “disapproved” by the commander of the U.S. Air Force Reserve Command.
She filed an appeal in December, which was also denied, this time by the Air Force surgeon general.
“I believe that God wants me to do certain things and I prayed multiple times what I should do. He told me not to do this,” Crocker said during a morning news conference outside the federal courthouse in downtown Shreveport. “I think it is wrong my chain of command is making me do something I’m not comfortable with and that is against my religion.”
The lawsuit also claims that earlier in March, Crocker was instructed to do one of the following within five calendar days: get the vaccine, submit a retirement request if eligible or refuse the vaccine in writing. She submitted the following response to her commander after retaining legal counsel: “As of today I will not be getting the COVID-19 vaccination. That being said, I love my country and will not give up the opportunity to serve but I also love my God and will honor Him in all that I do.”
Congressman Mike Johnson, R-Louisiana, was also present during the news conference to express his support for Crocker and his disapproval of the mandate. Johnson believes the mandate hinders military preparedness.
“When you balance it against the great harms and threats that are against our country, what we need them to be focused on, that affects our readiness,” he explained. “There are so many members of Congress that are deeply concerned about this. We feel this injustice is a bad policy for the Biden administration.”
The defendants listed in the complaint include Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, the Defense Department, Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall III, Air Force Surgeon General Robert Miller and Air Force Reserve Command Cmdr. Richard Scobee.
Crocker also argues that the mandate impacts her Air Force career and college education. She says she should not have to choose between God and country.
“I would like to be in the Air Force until I retire. I want to become an officer and a pilot or a chaplain,” she explained. “If I get kicked out, then I am not able to pursue my college career and all my dreams would be crushed.”
The lawsuit is also seeking a “preliminary or permanent” injunction prohibiting the Defense Department from enforcing the COVID-19 vaccine mandate against Crocker.
According to the lawsuit “... more than 4,637 religious accommodation requests have been denied, and only 17 granted.”

Services appear to be 'discriminatorily and systematically denying religious exemptions'
Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and all other military officials are barred from taking punitive action against two service members seeking religious exemptions to the military’s COVID-19 vaccine mandate, a federal judge ruled on Feb. 2.
The Marine Corps. lieutenant colonel and Navy Command officer appear to have been “wrongfully denied a religious exemption from COVID-19 vaccination,” U.S. District Judge Steven Merryday, a George H. W. Bush nominee, wrote in a 10-page ruling.
The lieutenant colonel was told she would be disciplined starting Feb. 2 if she didn’t receive a dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, according to court documents.
The Navy officer, meanwhile, was told he would be removed from command of his ship on Feb. 3 if he didn’t start a COVID-19 vaccination series.
Both saw their religious exemption applications denied and appeals to the denials rejected.
Top military officials determined that the commander’s religious beliefs were sincere and that they would be “substantially burdened” by being forced to get vaccinated, but also claimed that granting the exemption request “would have a predictable and detrimental effect on the readiness of you and the Sailors who serve alongside you.”
In the Marine’s case, the lieutenant colonel’s religious opposition to any vaccine developed with fetal cell lines—all three COVID-19 shots cleared by U.S. regulators utilized aborted cells—stemmed from becoming pregnant from a rape, she said in a sworn declaration.
The rejection letter was identical to the letters received by 16 other sailors whose applications were denied despite each sailor getting their request endorsed by the woman, who is the unit’s commanding officer, and each sailor submitting “distinct, personal accounts of our religious practices and the method by which receipt of the COVID-19 vaccine would violate those tenets,” she stated.
The denial letter, presented to the court, showed that a Marine official questioned whether getting a COVID-19 vaccine would substantially burden a religious belief, because the same objections the lieutenant colonel lodged “could be made for every FDA approved vaccine [she has] received” in the military.
Even if the case could be made of a substantial burden, the official said that “the government’s compelling interests in military readiness and in the health and safety of the force” justified denying the request.
Both the Navy and Marine rejections failed to note that the branches have separately granted hundreds of medical exemptions to the COVID-19 vaccine mandate, Merryday wrote.
The record in the case “creates a strong inference that the services are discriminatorily and systematically denying religious exemptions without a meaningful and fair hearing and without the showing required under RFRA (while simultaneously granting medical exemptions and permitting unvaccinated persons to continue in service without adverse consequence),” he said.
RFRA refers to the Religious Freedom Restoration Act—a law that plaintiffs and defendants interpret differently.
The military hasn’t established, and likely can’t establish, “that permitting the relatively small number of RFRA objectors, even if every request for exemption (much less the two at issue in this motion) were sincere and successful, to serve without adverse consequences to their standing and the terms and conditions of their service will adversely affect the public’s interest in the maintenance and readiness of the nation’s military forces,” Merryday stated.
“In fact, the public undoubtedly has some considerable interest in maintaining the services of skilled, experienced, highly trained, patriotic, courageous, and esteemed service members, such as the two moving service members, in whom the public has an immense financial investment and who are not, to say the least, readily replaceable.”
The judge blocked the punishment of the two members for now and ordered a hearing on Feb. 10 in federal court in Tampa, Florida.
Government lawyers had urged the court to not grant the request for a temporary restraining order, claiming it didn’t have jurisdiction to decide whether military commanders should remain in their positions.
“Plaintiffs invite this Court to begin judicial oversight of individual assignment, reassignment, and command decisions, asking this Court to enjoin the Navy from removing the commander of a warship and to stop withdrawal of another’s command selection. Such unprecedented judicial action would damage the military’s interests in readiness, health of service members, and good order and discipline, and the public interest in the national security of the United States,” they wrote in a filing that failed to sway the judge.",en,Judge Blocks Military From Punishing 2 Troops Seeking Religious Exemptions to Vaccine Mandate,RIGHT,MIXED,LOW CREDIBILITY,,TRUE

A federal appeals court on Monday ruled to keep a lower court order in place, temporarily preventing the Navy and the Department of Defense from taking adverse action against a group of three dozen service members who object to the COVID-19 vaccine on religious grounds.
In the Feb. 28 decision, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a preliminary injunction issued by the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas in January, which prevents the Department of Defense from taking “any adverse action” against the plaintiffs in the case because of requests for religious accommodation.
In August 2021, the Pentagon announced that all service members would have to be vaccinated against COVID-19, and over 99% now are. The Department of Defence had maintained that “[f]orcing the Navy to deploy plaintiffs while they are unvaccinated threatens the success of critical missions and needlessly endangers the health and safety of other service members.”
The 3-judge appeals court wrote, however, that the Navy has “not demonstrated ‘paramount interests’ that justify vaccinating these 35 Plaintiffs against COVID-19 in violation of their religious beliefs,” noting that the Navy has granted temporary medical exemptions to “hundreds” of service members.",en,Appeals court: Navy service members requesting religious exemption to COVID vaccine should not be punished,RIGHT,,,,

As of Wednesday, two out of 3,212 religious exemption requests have been granted for the vaccine, that all active duty Marines were required to receive by Nov. 28.
The religious exemptions are not only the first given by the military for the COVID-19 vaccine, but the first religious exemption to a vaccine the Marine Corps has given in at least 10 years.
The Marine Corps has received 3,350 requests for the COVID-19 vaccine and has processed a total of 3,212.

“Due to privacy considerations, we are unable to discuss the specifics of any individual requests,” Capt. Andrew Wood said in a Thursday email.
Religious exemptions go through a long chain of review before a final decision is made on them, Wood said.
The initial request is reviewed by the first lieutenant colonel commander, colonel commander and commanding general in the requesting Marine’s chain of command before being sent off to deputy commandant for manpower and reserve affairs, Wood said.
Within Manpower and Reserve Affairs, a three-person panel reviews each request before making a recommendation to the deputy commandant.
If the request is denied, the Marine who initially filed the request has the right to appeal to the assistant commandant of the Marine Corps, who then personally reviews each appeal before making a final decision.
“At every step, each accommodation request is given full consideration with respect to the facts and circumstances submitted in the request. In each case, every reviewer weighs the compelling government interest against the individual’s request and the circumstances of their situation,” Wood said in a statement.
Wood went on to add: “The Marine Corps has a compelling government interest in mission accomplishment at the individual, unit, and organizational levels. The necessary elements of mission accomplishment include: (1) military readiness; (2) unit cohesion; (3) good order and discipline; and (4) health and safety. Adjudication Authorities pay particular attention to how religious accommodation request determinations will impact the Marine’s and unit’s ability to accomplish the mission, and consider the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling government interest.”
The Marine Corps has been the least vaccinated force in the Department of Defense since vaccine mandates were first sent out.
Marine Corps Commandant Gen. David Berger blamed the hesitancy on online misinformation when talking in early November.
“You have to ask each individual Marines their reason why,” Berger said on Nov. 4, at the Aspen Security Forum.
“But I think we’re challenged by disinformation … that still swirls around about where the genesis, how did this vaccine get approved, is it safe is it ethical ― all that swirls around on the internet and they see all that they read all that,” the commandant added.
As of Wednesday, 97% of the active duty Marine Corps is partially or fully vaccinated while 87% of the Marine Reserves is fully or partially vaccinated.
All Marines who fail to receive a religious, administrative or medical exemption to the vaccine will be separated from the Marine Corps, though language in the 2022 National Defense Authorization Act ensures those Marines will receive either an honorable or general under honorable conditions discharge.
Most medical or administrative exemptions are temporary, Wood said in an email. So far 943 Marines have approved administrative or medical exemptions.",en,2 Marines receive religious exemption to COVID-19 vaccine,CENTER,,,,

The Pentagon's inspector general warned that mass denials of religious exemption requests were ""concerning,"" according to an internal memo obtained by Military.com.
""We found a trend of generalized assessments rather than the individualized assessment that is required by Federal law and DoD and Military Service policies,"" Sean O'Donnell, the Pentagon's inspector general, said in the June 2 memo to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. ""Some of the appellate decisions included documentation that demonstrated a greater consideration of facts and circumstances involved in a request.""
The watchdog said that military officials likely spent only minutes reviewing exemption requests, providing potential grounds for legal challenges to the denial decisions.

""The volume and rate at which decisions were made to deny requests is concerning,"" the memo said. ""Assuming a 10-hour work day with no breaks or attention to other matters, the average review period was about 12 minutes for each package. Such a review period seems insufficient to process each request in an individualized manner and still perform the duties required of their position.""
Most of the services are still fighting legal battles over enforcing the vaccine mandate for troops, issued by Austin in August 2021. The Navy and Marine Corps are effectively in a holding pattern on removing service members who refused to be vaccinated against COVID-19. The Army National Guard has roughly 40,000 unvaccinated soldiers the service component hasn't figured out what to do with. And some 1,200 Coast Guardsmen are attempting to qualify for a class-action lawsuit in reaction to their religious exemptions being denied. The review process is a major factor in many of these cases.
The Army, by far the largest service, had rejected 1,602 religious exemption requests out of 8,514 across the active-duty and reserve components as of Aug. 12. Only 24 have been approved with the rest still pending. Overall, the inspector general found roughly 50 denials per day in a 90-day period across the services.
In the military, service members are required to be vaccinated against at least a dozen ailments, ranging from the flu to smallpox. The only way to be excused is through a religious waiver or an even more rare medical exemption -- reserved for extreme and rare cases such as if a service member is known to be at risk of myocarditis, a rare heart inflammation side effect of COVID vaccination.
The COVID-19 vaccines were politicized almost immediately by conservative pundits and some Republican lawmakers after being made available. Critics argued, without evidence, that the vaccines did not work or were broadly dangerous themselves, points that have been refuted by ostensibly every medical study.
Most religious objections are due to the use of fetal tissue in COVID-19 vaccine research. While researchers did use cell lines derived from elective abortion tissue originally created decades ago, that tissue was used to produce proteins for testing and wasn't put directly into the vaccine.
In addition, a vaccine that did not use fetal tissue in any part of its development, Novavax, was approved by the FDA, and subsequently the Pentagon, in August. Spokespeople for both the Navy and Marine Corps have confirmed to Military.com that the vaccine is available to their servicemembers.
Exemption requests among military members have been a point of controversy and debate since the introduction of the vaccine mandate, and at times have pitted religious leaders against those in their flock.
Andrew Torba, the head of Gab.com -- a far-right social media network that gained notoriety for being actively used by the man who was charged with killing 11 people at Pittsburgh's Tree of Life synagogue in 2018 -- wrote in a 2021 newsletter that he ""stumbled upon a set of religious exemption documents that the creator calls an 'air tight religious exemption request' for the COVID vaccine if it is mandatory for you at work, school, or in the military.""
The military template Torba offered was a 21-page document that argued the Eastern Orthodox church was against the vaccine. However, leaders of the Greek Orthodox Church in America said the opposite -- there was no exemption needed from them on the vaccine.
Pope Francis has similarly encouraged vaccination and so have leaders in Islam. One research paper even concluded that getting vaccinated was ""actually a form of compliance with Sharia law.""
Other service members have told Military.com that they sourced their exemption paperwork from secretive and hidden Facebook groups, sometimes citing arguments from people like Lt. Col.Theresa Long. Long, an Alabama-based Army surgeon, gained a following in vaccine refuser circles despite the fact that many of her claims made in court were filled with errors and inaccuracies.
Meanwhile, the legal challenges that vaccine refusers have filed in federal courts have made an impact. In late March, the Navy was forced to suspend discharging sailors with pending exemption requests after a Texas judge ruled that a case involving vaccine-refusing Navy SEALs would apply to the entire service -- just days after his earlier order to halt any Navy action against the SEALs was narrowed by the Supreme Court.
Last week, in response to an injunction issued by Judge Steven Merryday in federal court in Florida, the Marine Corps released a message saying it too was halting separations. The decision will impact about 1,150 Marines, according to a statement from the service.
Merryday was the same judge who in March forbade the Navy from reassigning a commander of a destroyer despite testimony that the man had flouted the service's rules for COVID-19 mitigation while seeking a religious exemption from the vaccine. Merryday called the officer ""triumphantly fit and slim and strong, who is robustly healthy, who is young."" He was later overruled by the Supreme Court.
Mark Zaid, a Washington, D.C.-based attorney who fought and prevailed over the military's last major vaccine mandate for anthrax, had previously told Military.com that it's no accident that many of the same judges have been appearing in vaccine cases.
""It's clearly forum shopping. ... I don't think it's surprising that stays were obtained in very conservative districts on religious issues,"" he said.
Service members were among the first populations of Americans eligible for vaccines, almost immediately as they hit the market. However, the Defense Department never issued a requirement for boosters. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the vaccine's effectiveness wanes over time, making it unclear whether troops inoculated right away are technically still vaccinated if they never got booster shots.
The news also comes as President Joe Biden declared the COVID-19 pandemic to be over, echoing the sentiment across the military as commanders have eliminated virtually all protective measures and units have returned to business as usual. The worst impacts of the coronavirus variants typically impact the elderly or people with other health ailments including obesity and diabetes -- not the usually younger and relatively physically fit population of the military. A total of 95 service members have died from COVID-19 since the pandemic began.
""We still have a problem with COVID,"" the president said Sunday on ""60 Minutes."" ""We're still doing a lot of work on it. … If you notice, no one's wearing masks. … Everybody seems to be in pretty good shape.""

The officers, mostly from Wright-Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton, Ohio, along with a handful of airmen and reservists, accused the Air Force of using a double standard when approving the requests.
The Air Force, according to the lawsuit filed last week, had allowed more than 3,000 medical and administrative exemptions but only nine religious exemptions.
“The granting of more than one thousand medical and administrative exemptions belies any assertion that vaccination is mission-critical and that no exemptions can be granted,” the lawsuit said.
A message seeking comment on the lawsuit was left with an Air Force spokesperson Wednesday.

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and military leaders have said the vaccine is critical to maintaining military readiness and the health of the force. But members of Congress, the military and the public have questioned if the exemption reviews have been fair.

At least 97% of the troops in each service have gotten at least one shot, while those who refuse can face discipline up to being discharged from the service.
Those who filed the lawsuit in Ohio said they had followed their chain of command and each had talked with an Air Force chaplain to determine the sincerity of their beliefs.
Many also said they already had been infected with COVID-19 and that antibody tests show they now have natural immunity, according to the lawsuit.

1773,washingtonexaminer.com,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/federal-judge-blocks-dod-navy-seal-vaccine-mandate,"A federal judge barred the Department of Defense from punishing a group of Navy SEALs for refusing to get vaccinated on religious grounds.
District Judge Reed O'Connor granted a preliminary injunction on Monday in response to a lawsuit filed for 35 unnamed Navy SEALs who had sued the Biden administration in November, alleging they had received several disciplinary measures for seeking a religious exemption.
""The Navy service members, in this case, seek to vindicate the very freedoms they have sacrificed so much to protect,"" O'Connor wrote in a filing on Monday. ""The COVID-19 pandemic provides the government no license to abrogate those freedoms. There is no COVID-19 exception to the First Amendment. There is no military exclusion from our Constitution.""
At the heart of the lawsuit is Secretary Lloyd Austin's vaccination mandate for the coronavirus, and whether he has the authority to issue the order. He gave each branch the power to come up with their own policy surrounding the vaccine.
The SEALs allege that they faced a range of disciplinary measures, including being administratively separated from vaccinated colleagues or dismissed, the initial lawsuit claims.
ERRANT DRONE STRIKES RAISE QUESTIONS ABOUT SAFEGUARDS TO PREVENT CIVILIAN CASUALTIES
The SEALs expressed opposition to the vaccines based on the sincerely held belief that aborted fetal cells were used to develop the vaccine, the belief that ""modifying one's body is an affront to the Creator,"" and ""direct, divine instruction not to receive the vaccine,"" the ruling states.
Fetal cell lines are used in the development of vaccines, but the cells typically used are from an aborted fetus three decades ago, experts report. They're also the same cell lines used in the development of many common drugs, including aspirin and ibuprofen.
Of the 35 named in the suit, 19 had filed requests for a religious exemption, only to have it denied by the Navy, the federal judge wrote.
""The Navy has not granted a religious exemption to any vaccine in recent memory,"" O'Connor wrote. ""It merely rubber stamps each denial.""
As of Dec. 17, the military has not approved a single religious exemption to the COVID-19 vaccine, even as more than 12,000 service members sought one. Each service branch is overwhelmingly vaccinated and those who have refused remain a tiny percentage, though the number is in the thousands given the sheer size of the military. The branches have already begun discharging those who have failed to comply with the order and have either not applied for or been denied an exemption.
O'Connor also argued that the threat of spreading COVID-19 among the Navy's sailors is not sufficient to justify denying the sailors their First Amendment rights.
""The Plaintiffs' loss of religious liberties outweighs any forthcoming harm to the Navy. Even the direst circumstances cannot justify the loss of constitutional rights. Fortunately, the future does not look so dire. Nearly 100% of the Navy has been vaccinated,"" O'Connor wrote.
Dozens of Republican lawmakers filed an amicus brief in support of the SEALs last month while the America First Policy Institute, a policy group backed by former President Donald Trump, did in November.
First Liberty Institute, the religious freedom legal organization representing the 35 SEALs in the Northern District of Texas, declared the ruling a victory.

US Air Force Grants 9 Religious Exemptions to COVID-19 Vaccine Mandate While Over 3,000 Requests Rejected
The Air Force on Tuesday said it has approved nine religious exemptions from taking the COVID-19 vaccine, while more than 3,000 requests have been rejected so far.
According to data from the Air Force, eight of the exemptions to the military’s COVID-19 vaccine mandate were granted after being submitted, and a further religious exemption was approved after an appeal.
A total of 3,222 religious accommodation requests have been rejected, and the Air Force is processing 2,556 pending requests for exemptions and 732 pending appeals.
The Air Force is the second U.S. military branch to approve religious exemptions to the mandatory COVID-19 vaccine, although the nine approved so far represent just a tiny fraction of the more than 6,400 requested by Air Force troops.
“The Department of the Air Force determined the service members’ accommodations could be supported with no impact to mission readiness,” a statement Tuesday said.
The Marine Corps is the only other military service to grant any religious accommodations, allowing three so far. On Jan. 13, it granted religious exemptions to the military’s COVID-19 vaccine mandate, nearly two months after the vaccination deadline for active-duty Marines.
The Army and Navy have not approved any religious exemptions. As of Jan. 26, the Army had rejected 266 requests for permanent religious exemptions.
The Navy in its latest release on Feb. 2 noted that there have been 118 “separations” so far for refusing the COVID-19 vaccine. Court documents dated Feb. 3 note out of 4,095 total initial requests, the Navy has denied 3,278, and 285 are under review.
As of Feb. 3, a total of 3,458 requests for religious accommodation out of 3,539 initial requests have been rejected by the U.S. Marine Corps, while 81 requests are pending review, court papers show.
The U.S. Coast Guard has denied 578 of 1,308 initial requests for religious exemption from the vaccine mandate, and 715 requests are under review.
The Air Force’s latest data states that as of Feb. 7, the Air Force has “administratively separated” 142 active-duty airmen.
A total of 97.8 percent of active-duty airmen are fully vaccinated against COVID-19, the disease caused by the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) virus, with 96 percent of the Air Force vaccinated overall, the latest statistics show.

The military services have come under criticism for their failure to grant religious exemptions, with members of Congress, the military, and the public questioning if the review processes have been fair. Altogether, the services have received more than 14,000 requests for religious exemptions.
Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and military leaders have argued that the vaccine is critical to maintaining military readiness and the health of the force. And all of the services have now either discharged personnel for refusing the vaccine or put a system in place to do so.
Austin announced the mandate in August 2021, but every branch had resisted granting religious accommodations, sparking lawsuits and allegations that the military was violating federal law by discriminating against religious troop members.
The Marine Corps has discharged 469, the Air Force has discharged 179 and the Navy has discharged 118, according to data released in the last week. The number includes active-duty personnel and entry-level recruits who were still in boot camp. The Army has issued more than 3,000 formal letters of reprimand, and fired six soldiers, but has not discharged anyone yet.

The Marine Corps. lieutenant colonel and Navy Command officer appear to have been “wrongfully denied a religious exemption from COVID-19 vaccination,” U.S. District Judge Steven Merryday, a George H. W. Bush nominee, wrote in a 10-page ruling.
The lieutenant colonel was told she would be disciplined starting Feb. 2 if she did not get one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, according to court documents.
The Navy officer, meanwhile, was told he would be removed from command of his ship on Feb. 3 if he did not start a COVID-19 vaccination series.
Both saw their religious exemption applications denied and appeals to the denials rejected.
Top military officials determined that the commander’s religious beliefs are sincere and would be “substantially burdened” by being forced to get vaccinated, but also claimed that granting the exemption request “would have a predictable and detrimental effect on the readiness of you and the Sailors who serve alongside you.”
In the Marines case, the lieutenant colonel’s religious opposition to any vaccine developed with fetal cell lines—all three COVID-19 shots cleared by U.S. regulators utilized aborted cells—stemmed from becoming pregnant from a rape, she said in a sworn declaration.
The rejection letter was identical to the letters received by 16 other sailors whose applications were denied despite each sailor getting their request endorsed by the woman, who is the unit’s commanding officer, and each sailor submitting “distinct, personal accounts of our religious practices and the method by which receipt of the COVID-19 vaccine would violate those tenets,” she added.
The denial letter, presented to the court, showed that a Marine official questioned whether getting a COVID-19 vaccine would substantially burden a religious belief because the same objections the lieutenant colonel lodged “could be made for every FDA approved vaccine [she has] received” in the military.
Even if the case could be made of a substantial burden, the official said that “the government’s compelling interests in military readiness and in the health and safety of the force” justified denying the request.
Both the Navy and Marine rejections failed to note that the branches have separately granted hundreds of medical exemptions to the COVID-19 vaccine mandate, Merryday, the judge, wrote.
The record in the case “creates a strong inference that the services are discriminatorily and systematically denying religious exemptions without a meaningful and fair hearing and without the showing required under RFRA (while simultaneously granting medical exemptions and permitting unvaccinated persons to continue in service without adverse consequence),” he said.
RFRA refers to the Religious Freedom Restoration Act—a law plaintiffs and defendants interpret differently.
The military has not established, and likely cannot establish, “that permitting the relatively small number of RFRA objectors, even if every request for exemption (much less the two at issue in this motion) were sincere and successful, to serve without adverse consequences to their standing and the terms and conditions of their service will adversely affect the public’s interest in the maintenance and readiness of the nation’s military forces,” Merryday added later. “In fact, the public undoubtedly has some considerable interest in maintaining the services of skilled, experienced, highly trained, patriotic, courageous, and esteemed service members, such as the two moving service members, in whom the public has an immense financial investment and who are not, to say the least, readily replaceable.”
The judge blocked punishment of the two members for now and ordered a hearing on Feb. 10 in federal court in Tampa, Florida.
Government lawyers had urged the court to not grant the request for a temporary restraining order, claiming it did not have jurisdiction to decide whether military commanders should remain in their positions.
“Plaintiffs invite this Court to begin judicial oversight of individual assignment, reassignment, and command decisions, asking this Court to enjoin the Navy from removing the commander of a warship and to stop withdrawal of another’s command selection. Such unprecedented judicial action would damage the military’s interests in readiness, health of service members, and good order and discipline, and the public interest in the national security of the United States,” they wrote in a filing that failed to sway the judge.

1924,heritage.org,https://www.heritage.org/courts/commentary/court-delivers-win-military-members-denied-religious-exemptions-pentagon-vaccine,"In one of many ongoing federal lawsuits challenging COVID-19 vaccine mandates across the country, Judge Reed O’Connor of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas issued a group of Navy SEALs and Naval Special Warfare personnel a resounding victory Jan. 3 in U.S. Navy SEALs 1-26 v. Biden.
In his order, O’Connor granted an injunction against the Biden administration and the Department of Defense, preventing them from enforcing the vaccine mandate against any of the named service members who had applied for a religious exemption.
O’Connor ruled that the blanket denial of their religious waiver requests amounted to a violation of the service members’ rights under the First Amendment and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.
Under that law, the government may substantially burden a person’s exercise of religion only if it demonstrates that burden is (1) in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest; and (2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that interest.
For O’Connor, the violation of the law was clear:
Defendants have substantially burdened Plaintiffs’ religious beliefs. The government burdens religion when it ‘put[s] substantial pressure on an adherent to modify his behavior and to violate his beliefs.’ That is especially true when the government imposes a choice between one’s job and one’s religious belief. Here, Plaintiffs must decide whether to lose their livelihoods or violate sincerely held religious beliefs. Because they will not compromise these religious beliefs, Plaintiffs have been threatened with separation from the military and other disciplinary action.
Like the other service branches, the Navy required all active-duty service members to be fully vaccinated before Nov. 28 or risk a “full range” of disciplinary action.
While it allowed service members to apply for religious exemptions to the mandate, it has not granted a single one. In fact, as of Dec. 17, the religious accommodation requests of at least 29 of the 35 naval plaintiffs had been flatly denied.
The Navy has, however, granted medical exemption requests submitted by other personnel.
This disparity of treatment between medical and religious exemptions was constitutionally prohibited, O’Connor said:
As a brief preview, the vaccine mandate fails strict scrutiny. The mandate treats comparable secular activity (e.g., medical exemptions) more favorably than religious activity.
The service members who filed the lawsuit represent more than 350 collective years of military service, and more than 100 combat deployments. When they inquired about seeking religious accommodation for the vaccine, the Navy informed many of them that they could face court-martial or involuntary separation if they refused to take the vaccine.
According to the First Liberty Institute, the public interest law firm representing the service members, each of the denials appeared to be identical, suggesting the Navy had not taken any of the religious exemption requests seriously.
O’Connor made note of this in his order, calling the process for seeking a religious exemption nothing more than “theater,” stating that the Navy “merely rubber-stamps each denial,” and stressing that “the record overwhelmingly demonstrates that the Navy’s religious-accommodation process is an exercise in futility.”
“The Navy service members in this case seek to vindicate the very freedoms they have sacrificed so much to protect,” O’Connor wrote, adding:
The COVID-19 pandemic provides the government no license to abrogate those freedoms. There is no COVID-19 exception to the First Amendment. There is no military exclusion from our Constitution.
Mike Berry, general counsel for First Liberty Institute, said:
Forcing a service member to choose between their faith and serving their country is abhorrent to the Constitution and America’s values … . Punishing SEALs for simply asking for a religious accommodation is purely vindictive and punitive. We’re pleased that the court has acted to protect our brave warriors before more damage is done to our national security.
The next stop in the litigation is likely to be an appeal by the Department of Defense and the Biden administration to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit.
Other federal court challenges to various COVID-19 vaccine mandates are ongoing.
On Jan. 7, the Supreme Court is set to hear oral arguments in a set of high-profile, consolidated cases on the Biden administration’s vaccine mandates for private-sector entities with 100 or more employees, and for health care facilities that receive Medicaid and Medicare funding.
The Heritage Foundation, a petitioner in the case challenging the private-sector vaccine mandate, has asked the court to invalidate the government’s order. (The Daily Signal is the news outlet of The Heritage Foundation.)
While the Jan. 3 victory applies only to the named naval personnel in the lawsuit and not to the entire vaccine mandate issued by the Department of Defense, for religious freedom advocates and faithful Americans, the victory is a breath of fresh air and a much-needed reminder that individuals who have selflessly committed themselves to the defense of the Constitution and its enshrined liberties are sometimes the very people whose rights need defending the most.

1975,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/17/politics/us-military-religious-exemptions-covid-vaccine/index.html,"CNN —
The US military has approved religious exemptions to its Covid-19 vaccine mandate for 15 service members out of approximately 16,000 requests, according to the latest data from the services.
The Marine Corps has approved religious exemptions for six Marines and the Air Force has approved nine requests for exemptions. The Navy has given conditional approval for a member of the Individual Ready Reserve, but that member would have to be fully vaccinated before returning to service.
The military’s vaccine mandate, instituted shortly after the US Food and Drug Administration granted full approval of the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine, has faced legal challenges, despite the high vaccination rate of service members.
A federal judge in Georgia ruled this week that an anonymous Air Force officer who was denied a religious exemption does not have to receive a Covid-19 vaccine because of her religious beliefs.
Judge Tilman Self ruled that the mandate violated the officer’s religious freedoms. “What real interest can our military leaders have in furthering a requirement that violates the very document they swore to support and defend?” Self wrote in his order.
While the ruling only applies to the one officer who filed the lawsuit, the order in her favor could encourage other challenges to the vaccine mandate.
In a separate, ongoing federal case in Texas, a judge ruled that the Navy could not take adverse actions or punish a group of 35 Navy SEALS who claimed a religious exemption from the requirement.
Meanwhile, a number of Republican governors have challenged the mandate for the National Guard, asserting that they are the commanders of the state units, not the federal government. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin dismissed those objections, arguing they do not negate the need for what he has long considered an important military medical readiness requirement.
These cases remain the exception. The active duty military, composed of more than 1.3 million service members, is more than 97% vaccinated, while the total force, including reserves and the National Guard, is approximately 90% vaccinated.
Marines have requested a total of 3,595 religious exemptions, according to the latest data from the Marine Corps. As of this week, 640 Marines have been separated from the service for refusing the lawful order to receive a vaccine.
The Air Force has approved a total of nine exemptions and rejected 3,381. Another 2,664 requests are still pending. The Air Force has separated 160 service members for refusing the vaccine.
The Navy has received 3,369 religious exemption requests, but none have been approved, according to data released by the service. A total of 247 active duty sailors and one reserve sailor have been separated for refusing the vaccine. There were another 22 entry-level separations for those refusing the vaccine within their first 180 days of active duty.
The Army has received 3,088 religious exemptions requests and granted zero of them. The Army only recently put into place its separation policy and has not yet discharged anyone for refusing the vaccine, according to the latest data.",en,"US Military has approved religious exemptions to vaccine mandate for 15 service members out of 16,000 requests",LEFT,MIXED,MEDIUM CREDIBILITY,,

The data released Tuesday also states that 142 active duty airmen have been ""administratively separated"" as of Monday afternoon.
The Marine Corps is the only other military service that has approved religious exemptions, granting three so far, according to the Associated Press.
The Air Force data states that 97.8 percent of active duty airmen are fully vaccinated, and combined with reserve and National Guard members, the Air Force is 96 percent vaccinated overall.
Eight of the exemption requests were granted on initial review, and one was granted on appeal. The Air Force has denied 443 appeals, while over 2,500 exemption requests and 730 appeals are pending.
The Air Force data also shows that the service has approved 1,476 medical exemptions, which are determined by a service member's medical provider, along with 1,837 administrative exemptions, which are determined on an individual basis. The release states that most of the administrative requests that have been granted are because a service member had a request for ""separation or retirement"" by November 1.
The AP reported that overall, the U.S. military has seen over 14,000 requests for religious exemptions to the Pentagon's vaccine mandate for all military service members.
Military officials have said that religious exemptions are rarely granted for the up to 17 other vaccines service members are required to get, and therefore COVID vaccine exemptions should be treated the same way, the AP reported.
Last week, the Army became the final military service to announce its intention to discharge service members refusing to comply with the mandate, putting 3,350 soldiers in jeopardy of being removed from that branch. In last week's statement, the Army said 3,073 ""official reprimands"" had been issued to those who were refusing the vaccine.
""Army readiness depends on soldiers who are prepared to train, deploy, fight and win our nation's wars,"" Secretary of the Army Christine Wormuth said in the news release. ""Unvaccinated soldiers present risk to the force and jeopardize readiness. We will begin involuntary separation proceedings for soldiers who refuse the vaccine order and are not pending a final decision on an exemption.""
The Marine Corps has discharged 469 service members, and the Navy has discharged 118, according to the AP.

First Liberty Institute, representing the plaintiffs, filed the motion requesting the court hold a hearing to order the Navy and Defense Department to explain why they should not be held in contempt of court.
""Navy SEAL 26 continues to be denied permission to travel to a treatment program for traumatic brain injuries, which this Court already called an 'egregious example' of harm suffered by Plaintiffs,"" the motion claims. ""Continuing to ignore this SEAL's medical needs, even in the face of the Court’s explicit recognition of the harm to this SEAL in the preliminary-injunction order, is simply inexcusable.""
The SEAL offered to pay for his own travel to treatment, but was denied after ""multiple high-ranking Naval officers in SEAL 26's command began calling the treatment center and asking if it would deny treatment to someone who is unvaccinated,"" which delayed his request and caused his spot at the treatment center to be lost.
Another plaintiff has been forced to remain at a training location for four months instead of four weeks and ""is required to get special permission from the Commanding Officer to leave the base for any reason, even to get groceries or fill his car with gas,"" according to the motion.
Meanwhile, other SEALs are also being denied opportunities for training and deployment.
""It is reprehensible that the Navy would deny health care to a Navy SEAL suffering the effects of traumatic brain injury,"" Mike Berry, general counsel for First Liberty Institute, said in a statement.
""Despite the Court's clear order prohibiting this kind of vindictive abuse, the Navy continues to punish and harass these warriors,"" he alleged. ""The Navy continues to deny our clients training and deployment opportunities and is assigning these soldiers menial tasks instead of allowing them to defend our country. This religious discrimination must stop.""
The federal court ruled in January that the Navy ""merely rubber stamps each denial"" of COVID vaccine Religious Accommodation Requests, which the judge said was unconstitutional.
""Our nation asks the men and women in our military to serve, suffer, and sacrifice,"" Judge Reed O'Connor wrote in his approval of the preliminary injunction against the vaccine mandate for the 35 plaintiffs.

2500,military.com,https://www.military.com/daily-news/2022/02/23/air-force-officers-sue-over-religious-exemption-denials.html,"Toledo, Ohio — A dozen U.S. Air Force officers have filed a lawsuit against the federal government after the military denied their religious exemptions to the mandatory COVID-19 vaccine.
The officers, mostly from Wright-Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton, Ohio, along with a handful of airmen and reservists, accused the Air Force of using a double standard when approving the requests.
The Air Force, according to the lawsuit filed last week, had allowed more than 3,000 medical and administrative exemptions but only nine religious exemptions.
“The granting of more than one thousand medical and administrative exemptions belies any assertion that vaccination is mission-critical and that no exemptions can be granted,"" the lawsuit said.
A message seeking comment on the lawsuit was left with an Air Force spokesperson Wednesday.
Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and military leaders have said the vaccine is critical to maintaining military readiness and the health of the force. But members of Congress, the military and the public have questioned if the exemption reviews have been fair.
Combined, the services have received more than 14,000 requests for religious accommodations. The Marine Corps had allowed three as of last week while the Army and Navy had not approved any.
At least 97% of the troops in each service have gotten at least one shot, while those who refuse can face discipline up to being discharged from the service.
Those who filed the lawsuit in Ohio said they had followed their chain of command and each had talked with an Air Force chaplain to determine the sincerity of their beliefs.

2523,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/navy-quietly-rolled-back-punishments-seals-seeking-religious-exemptions-covid-vaccine,"EXCLUSIVE: The U.S. Navy quietly rolled back an order punishing SEALs who remain unvaccinated due to their religious beliefs, according to recent court documents.
The order, ""Trident Order #12,"" disqualified SEALs seeking religious exemptions from the COVID-19 vaccine from training, traveling for deployment and conducting other standard business. It was first issued on Sept. 24, 2021 by Rear Admiral H. W. Howard, the former commander of Naval Special Warfare Command, and all special warfare forces were initially expected to come into compliance with the vaccine mandate by mid-October 2021.
The order specifically said that ""Special Operations Designated Personnel (SEAL and SWCC) refusing to receive recommended vaccines based solely on personal or religious beliefs will still be medically disqualified."" In addition, unvaccinated SEALs seeking religious accommodations would have to fill out a separate waiver to remain deployable.
The order was put on hold due to a preliminary injunction issued by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in early 2022 as part of an ongoing lawsuit brought by First Liberty Institute and Hacker Stephens LLP on behalf of 35 active-duty SEALs and three reservists seeking a religious exemption to the mandate.
However, according to a new filing in the lawsuit , the Navy quietly rolled back Trident Order #12 on May 22, 2022, a few months after the injunction was issued.
NAVY SEALS SEEKING RELIGIOUS EXEMPTIONS TO VACCINE MANDATE FACING INTIMIDATION AND HARASSMENT, SOURCES SAY
A communication order was circulated by the Navy on May 23 with the subject: ""NSWC CLOSEOUT TO TRIDENT ORDER #12 - MANDATORY VACCINATION FOR COVID-19."" NSWC refers to the Naval Special Warfare Command.
""This order rescinds reference A,"" it states, referring to ""Ref A"" as ""Trident Order #12 on COVID-19 Vaccinations.""
The May 23 communication order also said Navy commands ""will continue to follow guidance, as appropriate, regarding COVID-19 vaccination, accommodation requests, and mitigation measures.""
It is not immediately clear whether the Navy replaced the order with any other document or the reasoning behind Trident Order #12's termination. The Navy spokesperson told Fox News Digital, ""The Navy does not comment on ongoing litigation.""
According to a filing from plaintiff attorney Heather Gebelin Hacker to a Fifth Circuit clerk, the legal team representing the SEALs only became aware of the recession of the order on Sept. 1, months after it was rolled back.
""To the best of counsel’s knowledge, Trident Order #12 was not replaced. As the Court will recall, Trident Order #12 stated that SEALs who are unvaccinated due to religious beliefs are medically disqualified, though SEALs who are unvaccinated due to medical reasons are not automatically disqualified. Trident Order #12 also implemented the COVID-19 vaccine mandate at the command level for Naval Special Warfare forces, setting a deadline of compliance for October 17, 2021,"" the SEALs' legal team wrote.
""A copy of the order rescinding Trident Order #12 is attached to this letter. The rescission of Trident Order # 12 does not appear to affect the applicability of Navy or DoD-wide vaccine policies to NSW personnel—it just appears to remove the command-level direction,"" Hackeron continued.
The lawsuit representing unvaccinated SEALs, first reported by Fox News Digital in November, has since been amended to extend to a class action lawsuit encompassing all Navy service members seeking religious accommodation.
ADMIRAL WHO SAID UNVAXXED SEALS CAUSE 'IMMEDIATE HARM' TO NAVY ADMITTED NO COMBAT OPERATIONS AFFECTED
First Liberty's Senior Counsel and Director of Military Affairs Mike Berry told Fox News Digital, ""Now that the Navy has rescinded this unlawful order, the only reason it won't allow our SEALs to get back to doing their jobs is because of their religious beliefs.""
""America faces many national security threats, and the Navy is suffering a historic recruiting crisis. There's no good reason to keep these trained and experienced warriors from serving,"" Berry said.

2616,justthenews.com,https://justthenews.com/nation/religion/dod-inspector-general-alerts-defense-secretary-blanket-denials-covid-vax-religious,"The Defense Department's inspector general has alerted the secretary of defense to apparent blanket denials of religious accommodation requests (RAR) for exemptions from the military COVID-19 vaccine mandate, which would be a violation of federal law.
The memo details ""potential noncompliance with standards for reviewing and documenting the denial of religious accommodation requests of Service members."" The acting inspector general noted that ""dozens of complaints"" had been received regarding denied RARs.
""We have found a trend of generalized assessments rather than the individualized assessment that is required by Federal law and DoD and Military Service policies,"" wrote acting Inspector General Sean O'Donnell.
The inspector general originally sent the memorandum to the defense secretary in June, but it was not forwarded to the secretaries of each military service and the DOD general counsel until three months later, on Sept. 2.
""Additionally, the volume and rate at which decisions were made to deny requests is concerning,"" the Office of the Inspector General added. ""The appeal authorities of the Services we reviewed indicated that an average of 50 denials per day were processed over a 90-day period. Assuming a 10-hour work day with no breaks or attention to other matters, the average review period was about 12 minutes for each package. Such a review period seems insufficient to process each request in an individualized manner and still perform the duties required of their position.""
Amid the many lawsuits against the Defense Department regarding denied RARs, one of the key arguments made by service members' legal counsel is that the denials were predetermined and nearly identical, contrary to the individualized assessment that they are supposed to receive.
""The Inspector General is now confirming what my clients and I have known for months,"" said attorney R. Davis Younts, who represents several military members who were denied religious exemptions. ""The DoD has been issuing blanket denials of religious accommodation requests from the beginning as part of a process designed to result in denials. It is our hope that the Department of Defense will take this finding, change course and begin to respect the religious and constitutional rights of service members.""
Younts first obtained the OIG memo from a whistleblower on Tuesday.
It is ""deeply troubling that the Secretary of Defense did not act on this information until September 2nd of 2022,"" he told Just the News. ""In the intervening months hundreds of military members who submitted religious accommodation requests were wrongfully discharged.""
Younts added, ""This document is further evidence that the military has and continues to discriminate against my clients because of their faith.""
Liberty Counsel, which is also representing military members whose RARs were denied, noted that in their lawsuit Navy SEAL 1 v. Austin, the latest filings from the Defense Department in February ""revealed that out of 24,818 religious exemption requests received, only four were granted, and three of those were questionable since at least two of those service members were already scheduled to leave the military.""
""The Biden administration and the Department of Defense are violating federal law by denying the religious free exercise rights of service members from the COVID shot mandate,"" said Liberty Counsel Founder and Chairman Mat Staver. ""Our service members swear an oath to defend the U.S. Constitution. Their oath to defend the Constitution and their willingness to give their lives for our freedom must not be illusory. The abuse must end.""
The Defense Department didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday.
The memo was revealed as 47 members of Congress wrote to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Thursday demanding an end to the COVID vaccine mandate for the military.
The lawmakers argued that the mandate is unnecessary and harming military readiness.
""At the very end of the fiscal year, the Army has only met 52% of its FY22 recruiting goal,"" they noted. ""How will it recruit another 75,000 troops beyond its annual target to account for vaccine-related discharges?""
The legislators emphasized the low risk COVID poses to healthy members of the military and the limited efficacy of the vaccines against new strains of the virus.
""Servicemembers under 40 years of age without comorbidities have nearly no chance of death from the virus, and study after study has shown that Covid vaccinations have negligible or even negative efficacy against the Omicron strains,"" they wrote.
""We also know that natural immunity provides better protection against infection and death than existing Covid vaccines, yet the Department still refuses to recognize it in lieu of vaccination,"" they added.",en,Pentagon watchdog flags potentially illegal blanket denials of COVID vax religious exemptions,RIGHT,MIXED,LOW CREDIBILITY,,TRUE

Michael Poffenbarger, a second lieutenant assigned to the 455th Operational Support Squadron at Wright-Patterson, sued in January over what he said was the “perfunctory” denial of a request for a religious exemption.
The suit filed last month sought — and now has been granted — a preliminary injunction against the Air Force from taking “punitive action” against Poffenbarger.
U.S. District Judge Thomas Rose granted what he called a “relatively limited preliminary injunction” that “essentially preserves the status quo during the pendency of this matter to prevent defendants from imposing any further adverse action against Poffenbarger (only) for his refusal to comply with an order requiring him to receive a Covid-19 vaccine.”
“The court finds that, at this stage of the litigation and based on what has been presented, Poffenbarger has shown a strong likelihood of success on the merits of his claims,” Rose wrote in the filing, which was issued Monday.
According to background presented in the filing, Poffenbarger enlisted in the Air Force in 2005, serving two overseas deployments. He was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Air Force Reserve in the fall of 2021.
The Air Force does not permit unvaccinated members to attend an “intelligence technical school” where Rose said Poffenbarger must be trained.
Last September, Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall, a defendant in the lawsuit, mandated the Covid-19 vaccine for Air Force members.
One argument by Poffenbarger is that Kendall, while allowing medical and administrative exemptions to the vaccine mandate, “gave directives to commanders, through official and/or unofficial channels, that religious accommodations were not to be granted to the Covid-19 vaccination policy.”
Rose cites Air Force data from early February, saying the service had granted 1,513 temporary medical exemptions and 2,314 total administrative exemptions from the mandate — but nine religious exemptions. The Air Force announced those exemptions after Poffenbarger filed his lawsuit in Cincinnati in January.
Rose wrote that the Air Force denied Poffenbarger’s request for an exemption, saying the “denial acknowledged the sincerity of his religious beliefs, but stated that mission readiness required Poffenbarger to receive Covid-19 vaccination.”
In a similar lawsuit also filed in Cincinnati’s federal court in mid-February, Poffenbarger’s attorney, Kentucky lawyer Chris Wiest, also represents at least 18 plaintiffs, of whom at least 10 officers and one enlisted Airman are said to serve, or recently have served, at Wright-Patterson.
An Air Force spokeswoman recently told the Dayton Daily News that the service does not comment on litigation.
But in an earlier filing with the court, the Air Force said vaccinations have “promoted readiness by reducing the risk of infections, hospitalizations, and deaths of service members.”
“An (Covid) outbreak at the secured facility at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base would likewise affect readiness,” the Air Force said in a Jan. 31 filing in Poffenbarger’s suit.” “An (Covid) outbreak at the secured facility at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base would likewise affect readiness,” the Air Force said in a Jan. 31 filing in Poffenbarger’s suit.” “The intelligence work performed by plaintiff’s unit supports the work of aircrews at the base, including providing vital intelligence on ‘current threat assessments, regional geopolitical trends, and a myriad of other classified topics based on the specific itinerary of the aircrew,’ as well as ‘receiv[ing] debriefs from returning aircrews to ensure the Intelligence section is providing the most up to date information and reports.’”

(Lynne Sladky/AP)
WASHINGTON — The Air Force became the second military service to approve religious exemptions to the mandatory COVID-19 vaccine, granting requests from nine airmen to avoid the shots, officials said Tuesday.
The nine approved so far represent just a tiny fraction of the more than 6,400 requested by Air Force troops, and they come as other service members are challenging the lack of religious exemptions in court cases. The Marine Corps is the only other military service to grant any religious accommodations, allowing three so far. The Army and Navy have not approved any.

The services have come under criticism for their failure to grant religious exemptions, with members of Congress, the military and the public questioning if the review processes have been fair. All together, the services have received more than 14,000 requests for religious exemptions.
Military leaders have argued that religious exemptions to any of the many vaccines troops are required to get have been very rare over the years. Service members are required to get as many as 17 different vaccines, depending on where they deploy.

A federal judge in Texas granted a preliminary injunction last month, stopping the Navy from acting against 35 sailors for refusing on religious grounds to comply with an order to get the COVID vaccine.
Eight of the Air Force approvals came during the initial review process, and one was granted on appeal to senior Air Force leaders. So far, religious exemption requests from more than 3,200 airmen were denied, and another 3,200 are pending.

“The Department of the Air Force determined the service members’ accommodations could be supported with no impact to mission readiness,” the statement Tuesday said.
Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and military leaders have argued that the vaccine is critical to maintaining military readiness and the health of the force. And all of the services have now either discharged personnel for refusing the vaccine, or put a system in place to do so.
The Marine Corps has discharged 469, the Air Force has discharged 179 and the Navy has discharged 118, according to data released in the last week. The number include active-duty personnel and entry-level recruits who were still in boot camp. The Army has issued more than 3,000 formal letters of reprimand, and fired six soldiers, but has not discharged anyone yet.
All the military services have said the exemption decisions are based not only on the individual request, but also on its impact on the unit, its mission and readiness, and the health and safety of other troops.
Those who get an exemption and are allowed to stay in the service may, however, see an impact on their jobs.
The Navy and the Marine Corps have said unvaccinated service members are not allowed to deploy out to sea on ships, where infections can more easily spread. Those who have approved exemptions — either medical, administrative or religious — are assigned to shore duties.

2991,alphanews.org,https://alphanews.org/dod-inspector-general-denying-religious-exemptions-violates-federal-law/,"An average of 50 denials were issued a day, the OIG found, in a more than 90-day period.
(The Center Square) — A Department of Defense Office of Inspector General report has found that officials in the U.S. military who issued widespread denials of religious exemption requests by service members who refused to take the COVID-19 shots violated federal law.
Acting Inspector General Sean O’Donnell sent a memo to Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin while the department continued to defend its position in court and as branches of the military sought to dishonorably discharge, punish and even evict from their housing service members who were in noncompliance with the vaccine mandate Austin issued last August.
O’Donnell’s June 2 memo also surfaced after federal judges have increasingly issued blistering rebukes of military leaders when granting class action status for plaintiffs in lawsuits filed in several states.
The memo was issued after the OIG performed an audit of the U.S. military branches’ processing of COVID-19 exemption requests for active-duty service members to determine if they were in compliance with federal law and U.S. military regulations. The OIG found that they weren’t.
O’Donnell told Austin he was writing to inform him of “potential noncompliance with standards for reviewing and documenting the denial of religious accommodation requests of Service members identified through complaints submitted to my office.”
He said the DOD’s hotline received dozens of complaints from service members and his office found “a trend of generalized assessments rather than the individualized assessment that is required by Federal law and DoD and Military Service policies.”
He points out that blanket denial memorandums given to service members from the Air Force and the Navy didn’t “reflect an individualized analysis, demonstrating that the Senior Military Official considered the full range of facts and circumstances relevant to the particular religious accommodation request.” Instead, they included “similar, if not identical, wording,” following an example like one given in the Air Force: “I disapprove your request for exemption from vaccinations under the provisions of AFI 48-110, paragraph 2-6.b.3.”
The Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 prohibits the government from substantially burdening a person’s exercise of religion unless it “demonstrates that application of the burden to the person is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest and is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest,” O’Donnell argues.
U.S. Military code requires officials to review each request individually, “considering the full range of facts and circumstances relevant to the specific request,” O’Donnell wrote. “The means that is least restrictive to the requestor’s religious practice and that does not impede a compelling governmental interest will be determinative.”
He also said, “the volume and rate at which decisions were made to deny requests is concerning.”
An average of 50 denials were issued a day, the OIG found, in a more than 90-day period.
“Assuming a 10-hour workday with no breaks or attention to other matters, the average review period was about 12 minutes” for each appeal submitted by a service member, he notes, which he says is “insufficient.”
The OIG’s findings were consistent with those of a federal judge in a lawsuit filed by the Orlando-based religious freedom organization, Liberty Counsel, in Navy SEAL 1 v. Biden (now Austin).
In February, Judge Steven Merryday ordered each branch of the military to report the status of religious exemptions filed every 14 days beginning January 7, 2022. By February 4, of the 24,818 religious exemption requests received, only four were granted.
Liberty Counsel Founder and Chairman Mat Staver said, “The Biden administration and the Department of Defense are violating federal law by denying the religious free exercise rights of service members from the COVID shot mandate. Our service members swear an oath to defend the U.S. Constitution. Their oath to defend the Constitution and their willingness to give their lives for our freedom must not be illusory. The abuse must end.”
U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Georgia Judge Tilman Self, III, also said earlier this year that the Air Force’s claim that it was providing a religious accommodation process “proved to be nothing more than a quixotic quest for Plaintiff because it was ‘by all accounts . . . theater.’”
Self calculated the percentage of religious exemption requests the Air Force granted was 0.24%.
In another case, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals handed the Biden administration another blow when it upheld a ruling by a federal district court judge who granted class certification for all members of the Air Force.
“The Department of Defense’s Covid vaccine mandate is deleterious to readiness and the military’s ability to fight and win wars,” they argue. “The vaccine provides negligible benefit to the young, fit members of our Armed Forces, and the mandate’s imposition is clearly affecting the Department’s ability to sustain combat formations and recruit future talent.”
Austin has not issued a public response to the memo or replied to the requests of the members of Congress. He and his administration maintain the mandate is imperative for mission readiness and have steadfastly defended their position in court. His administration has also argued that federal district judges don’t have jurisdiction to rule on military cases, an argument they’ve consistently lost.

3007,on.nbc10.com,http://on.nbc10.com/JOWGcGm,"A dozen U.S. Air Force officers have filed a lawsuit against the federal government after the military denied their religious exemptions to the mandatory COVID-19 vaccine.
The officers, mostly from Wright-Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton, Ohio, along with a handful of airmen and reservists, accused the Air Force of using a double standard when approving the requests.
The Air Force, according to the lawsuit filed last week, had allowed more than 3,000 medical and administrative exemptions but only nine religious exemptions.
“The granting of more than one thousand medical and administrative exemptions belies any assertion that vaccination is mission-critical and that no exemptions can be granted,"" the lawsuit said.

A message seeking comment on the lawsuit was left with an Air Force spokesperson Wednesday.
Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and military leaders have said the vaccine is critical to maintaining military readiness and the health of the force. But members of Congress, the military and the public have questioned if the exemption reviews have been fair.
Combined, the services have received more than 14,000 requests for religious accommodations. The Marine Corps had allowed three as of last week while the Army and Navy had not approved any.
At least 97% of the troops in each service have gotten at least one shot, while those who refuse can face discipline up to being discharged from the service.
Those who filed the lawsuit in Ohio said they had followed their chain of command and each had talked with an Air Force chaplain to determine the sincerity of their beliefs.
Many also said they already had been infected with COVID-19 and that antibody tests show they now have natural immunity, according to the lawsuit.

SHREVEPORT — Barksdale Air Force Base Senior Airman Faith Crocker filed a lawsuit here Monday in federal court to block the Biden administration's COVID-19 vaccine mandate for military members, saying it violates her religious freedom.
The Pelican Institute for Public Policy, a conservative-leaning think tank in Louisiana, is representing Crocker in Louisiana U.S. Western District Court at the Tom Stagg U.S. District Courthouse.
Crocker's refusal to take the vaccine could result in her being drummed out of the U.S. Air Force without an honorable discharge, which she said would end her service, education and career dreams.
""This could derail my whole life and crush my dreams,"" said Crocker, 21, who has been in the U.S. Air Force three years.
Similar cases have already had some success with temporary injunctions against the mandate issued by federal judges in Florida and Texas, but Crocker's is the first test case in Louisiana.
""We're here to fight for her freedom and faith,"" said Crocker's attorney James Baehr.

Republican 4th District Congressman Mike Johnson of Benton was also on hand to support Crocker.
""There is no compelling government interest to trample on sincerely held religious beliefs of these service members in cases like this,"" Johnson said.
Johnson was among a group of 47 members of Congress who supported a number of U.S. Navy service members through an amicus brief in a similar case in Texas.
Crocker, who is a member of the Southern Baptist denomination and whose father is a Baptist minister, said God doesn't want her to take the vaccine if she's unsure about its safety.
""My God doesn't want me to put anything in my body that I'm unsure of,"" she said. ""I've prayed about this for hours and hours.""
Crocker said she has taken other vaccines like the flu shot that she believes are safe. She said Southern Baptist leaders haven't told members of the denomination not to take the vaccine, but that each person of faith must follow her convictions.
""It's strictly between me and God,"" said Crocker, who is a member of a crew that loads weapons on Barksdale's B-52 bombers.
The vaccine mandate for military personnel was put in place in August 2021 with a deadline of Sept. 15. In December, the U.S. Air Force announced it had discharged 27 people for refusing to get the COVID-19 vaccine, according to Crocker's lawsuit.
Crocker said she wants to make a career out of the military with dreams of becoming an officer, a pilot and a chaplain, but if she's discharged she wouldn't be able to continue her education without the military benefits.
""I love my job and the people I work with,"" Crocker said. ""That's why I'm fighting to stay.""

3119,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/unvaxxed-navy-sailors-face-deplorable-living-conditions-inability-leave-while-religious-exemptions-pend,"U.S. Navy service members who are seeking religious exemptions to the Department of Defense's COVID-19 vaccine mandate have been transferred into deplorable living conditions and, in some cases, are unable to leave while awaiting termination from the military, according to court documents.
First Liberty Institute in November filed a lawsuit on behalf of 35 active-duty SEALs and three reservists seeking a religious exemption to the mandate, as first reported by Fox News Digital. The case has since been amended to extend to a class action lawsuit encompassing all Navy service members seeking religious accommodation.
In March, the Supreme Court blocked a lower court's order in Texas that would have forced the Navy to stop implementing the vaccine mandate. Now, the case is continuing to be litigated in lower courts around the country, and unvaccinated SEALs and other sailors who have not yet been terminated by the U.S. government are stuck in limbo, with many of them forced into less-than-desirable alternative housing by the military or barred from traveling outside their base.
In a court filing in June by First Liberty in the Northern District of Texas Fort Worth Division District Court, sailors recounted deplorable conditions on large U.S. vessels, where they remain waiting as their cases are adjudicated.
ADMIRAL WHO SAID UNVAXXED SEALs CAUSE 'IMMEDIATE HARM' TO NAVY ADMITTED NO COMBAT OPERATIONS AFFECTED
One sailor who is now part of the class action lawsuit said in a court-filed declaration that they ""could not leave the area"" after asking to be terminated from the military due to religious objections to the mandate and were moved to the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower aircraft carrier's berthing barge, where the conditions are ""deplorable.""
""Because I could not leave the area, I moved onto the berthing barge for the Eisenhower. The conditions on the barge are deplorable, much like the USS George Washington, which is anchored in the same shipyard. There is mold everywhere and the barge’s toilets back up and leak. The water leaks out of the base of the toilet and collects near my rack and out into the hall. On bad days, it goes into the berthings on the other side. The leaks seem to be sewage—it smells like sewage and looks like it too. See Exhibit C (water I’ve mopped up from under my rack).""
LAWSUIT FILED ON BEHALF OF NAVY SEALs FACING INTIMIDATION FOR SEEKING RELIGIOUS COVID-19 VACCINE EXEMPTIONS
""There is some sort of worm thriving in the stagnant water in the toilet bowls and on the floor in the leaked water around the base of the toilets. Needless to say, I do not feel comfortable or safe in this environment and I have contacted mental health services multiple times,"" continued the sailor.
""I do want—desperately—to be separated from the Navy as soon as possible, but I struggle with withdrawing my request as I feel it could signal that my religious objection was somehow not genuine, and it is. It feels wrong to have to renounce my beliefs in order to get the Navy to separate me,"" they continued.
Another Navy technician who has served for more than nine years said in written testimony that their performance rating started suffering after submitting a religious exemption.
""Prior to the vaccine mandate, I consistently earned a ‘must promote’ rating on my performance evaluations. This year, because I submitted a religious accommodation and was planning on separating, I was given a ‘promote’ status. This downgrade in ranking makes it appear as if my skills as a sailor have regressed. I have maintained my work throughout the year and was told during a briefing on my evaluation that the rating was not due to my performance, but my upcoming separation because of the denial of my religious accommodation,"" they stated.
""To date, I am still unable to separate. My work environment feels extremely toxic over the vaccine issue, which has caused both my wife and I much stress. Because of my sincerely held religious objection, I will not take the COVID-19 vaccine. Because of the hardship and stress this process has brought to my family, I do not wish to be a part of the United States Navy anymore.""
Another Navy sailor said in sworn testimony that the Navy is ""refusing"" to separate them from service, despite the impending arrival of their second child.
""In anticipation of my separation, my wife and I sold our house, and my wife and one-year-old son have moved to another state. My wife is pregnant with our second child and her due date is in August 2022. I have been unable to join her and my son, or to start my new job, because the Navy has told me that I am not allowed to separate from the Navy due to this lawsuit.""
The Navy has not granted a single religious exemption to the mandate — there are currently 4,244 pending — but has granted 19 permanent medical exemptions, 189 temporary medical exemptions and 3 permanent medical exemptions, according to another recent filing by First Liberty.
""The USS Dwight D. Eisenhower (CVN 69), or ‘IKE’, is currently undergoing maintenance at Norfolk Naval Shipyard. When ships are in maintenance periods, Sailors on duty and those who do not have housing in town live on the berthing barge,"" Robert Myers, Commander of the Naval Air Force Atlantic said in a statement to Fox News Digital.
""Since moving the crew to the berthing barge more than a year ago, the Commanding Officer has assigned a senior officer to oversee and ensure living conditions are maintained within Navy standards. A five-person IKE team comprised of Sailors works with contractors to correct mechanical issues. Leaking or clogged plumbing, like any quality of life issues, are episodic and are corrected as soon as possible – often the same day or within 24 hours of being reported to leadership. Any discrepancies that are beyond the scope of Sailors assigned are directed to a contracted maintenance support team,"" he continued.
""The IKE crew conducts cleaning stations and sweepers daily, both on the IKE and also on the berthing barge. This All Hands effort is meant to ensure that Sailors – those living and working on the berthing barge – have ownership and pride in the spaces where they live and work.""
""The IKE has a very small number of Sailors refusing the COVID-19 vaccine and/or seeking an exemption from the vaccine. While undergoing the administrative process of being separated from the Navy, IKE leadership has provided opportunities to accommodate liberty requests (beyond weekends and holidays) for these Sailors to ensure they can prepare for life after the Navy. The Navy is not aware of any Sailors that were unable to leave while awaiting discharge from their obligated service.""
The Navy did not respond to Fox News Digital's questions regarding how long it takes to terminate a sailor or when sailors seeking a religious exemption to the vaccine would be allowed back onboard the USS Dwight D Eisenhower.

One former active-duty service member told Fox News Digital that there have been many examples over the years of less than desirable living quarters for service members.
He cited the Army's Fort Bragg in North Carolina, which had a series of issues in its barracks, including plumbing, rampant mold, asbestos and water leaks. The barracks, which were built in the 1970s, have become so problematic that soldiers had to be relocated.

The hammer is starting to fall on soldiers who are resisting getting their COVID-19 vaccinations as the Army continues its push for compliance, however the military saw it’s first religious exemptions for not getting the shot with two Marines getting passes.
Recent numbers provided by the Army show that a little more than 3,600 soldiers are refusing to get the shot.
While that makes up a very small number of the active duty force, the Army is following through on the punitive actions it promised for soldiers who refuse the shot.
To date, the Army has not separated any soldiers solely for refusing to get the shot, though that is the final step for soldiers who ultimately do not get vaccinated. However, the service said it issued nearly 3,000 general reprimands to soldiers refusing the vaccine order.
The service also relieved six active duty leaders and two battalion commanders of their duties.
Soldiers were supposed to be fully vaccinated in December. Reservists and members of the National Guard have until the end of June to meet the mandate.
The Army has approved nearly 6,000 temporary exemptions, but permanent exemptions are few and far between. Only five medical exemptions were approved out of about 650. There are still about 50 of those exemption requests pending.
A total of 2,128 soldiers requested religious accommodations. None have been approved and more than 160 have been disapproved.
The Marine Corps is already beginning to offload service members who refused to get the shot and has separated more than 350 troops. The Air Force and Navy have done the same, firing 87 airmen and 20 sailors.
The Marine Corps granted two religious exemptions last week. The military as a whole already denied thousands of religious accommodation requests. The Defense Department is taking a hard-nosed stance on religion as a means to avoid the vaccine. Applications ask for previous proof that service members have religious issues with other vaccines or medical treatments. Service members must get 17 different vaccines to serve.
The Marine Corps’ decision to permit the two exemptions are the first vaccine passes in 10 years.
In a statement, the Marines said “all current exemption requests are being reviewed on a case-by-case basis. Each request will be given full consideration with respect to the facts and circumstances submitted in the request. ”
The vast majority of service members are complying with the vaccine mandate. The Army’s active duty component is 96% vaccinated and the Reserve is already 73% vaccinated.
All of the other services are in the same range with vaccination compliance in the mid- to high-90s range. — SM

DoD finally ready to be done with DUNS
It’s been a long time coming, but the Defense Department is telling its acquisition professionals it’s time to ditch the proprietary numbering system the government has used to identify its contractors for more than 25 years.
In a Jan. 7 memo to the workforce, the department’s top contracting policy official said DoD organizations should start transitioning away from Dun & Bradstreet’s system of DUNS numbers as soon as they can. After several years of preparation, the government as a whole is making its final move to a new system called the Unique Entity Identifier (UEI) in April.
“This transition allows the government to streamline the entity identification and validation process, making it easier and less burdensome for entities to do business with the federal government,” wrote John Tenaglia, the principal director in DoD’s Defense Pricing and Contracting office. “We encourage you to transition as soon as practicable to ensure your systems have time to address any implementation issues with [the General Services Administration] before GSA retires the use of the DUNS number.”
The government’s reliance on DUNS numbers to keep track of vendors dates back to the 1970s, but it’s been essentially mandatory for federal agencies to use them — and for contactors to register for numbers with Dun & Bradstreet — since 2003. It’s been especially useful to keep track of which company named, say, “AAA Building Supply” you’re talking about when you’re writing a contract or tracking spending, or to differentiate between various business units of a big conglomerate.
GSA has been thinking through ways to replace the system since at least 2012, the same year a Government Accountability Office report noted the government’s reliance on a sole-source contract to track its vendors was becoming increasingly expensive.
At that point, GSA’s agreement with Dun & Bradstreet to borrow its numbering scheme was costing about $19 million per year, GAO found. And GSA paid the company nearly $208 million between 2010 and 2022, according to figures in the government’s USASpending database.
The contract terms were also fairly restrictive: Other agencies who needed to query Dun & Bradstreet’s DUNS database for research or other purposes had to reach their own licensing agreements with the firm and pay separately. And anyone searching the government’s Federal Procurement Data System was presented with a spooky message cautioning them they weren’t allowed to use the DUNS numbers — ubiquitous throughout FPDS — for purposes that aren’t specifically “permissible” under the company’s agreement with GSA.
For a time, the requirement to use DUNS numbers was specifically written into the Federal Acquisition Regulation. The FAR Council, realizing it was a bad look for a body of regulation that insists on fair and open competition to also require the use of a specific company’s product, removed that requirement in 2016 in preparation for the eventual move to UEIs, the Congressional Research Service notes.
A good part of the transition has already happened. Under the new government-operated numbering system, GSA has already issued new UEI numbers to every vendor that’s registered in the System for Award Management (SAM). From now on, new contractors will get those numbers automatically, rather than having to register with Dun & Bradstreet separately.
DoD’s main, aging contract writing system, the Standard Procurement System, has also been successfully updated to use the new UEIs, Tenaglia wrote. The new numbers won’t become the “authoritative” identifiers and won’t fully replace DUNS until April 4.
Until then, prime contractors will still need to use DUNS numbers to report their subcontracting data. But after that, they’ll have to use UEIs. That’s when DUNS will be officially dead — at least for government contracting purposes. —JS
DoD establishes cybersecurity consortium with universities
The Defense Department is teaming up with academia to start a new consortium focused on cybersecurity.
The Department of Defense Consortium for Cybersecurity (UC2) will open up communication between the Pentagon and schools and vice versa on creative ways to protect networks.
The consortium is putting particular emphasis on community colleges and Historically Black Colleges and Universities.
“Diversity of ideas will create the best innovation,” Heidi Shyu, DoD undersecretary for research and engineering, said at the consortium kickoff.
The schools and DoD will share insights and recommendations.
“The detailed information will come out a bit later,” Shyu told reporters at a Defense Writers Group forum. “We have specific challenges or have specific research areas we are interested in like zero trust. You can utilize this consortium to develop the critical enabling technologies.”
The consortium stems from a mandate in the 2020 defense authorization act. That law tells DoD to develop partnerships with schools to improve security.
“The functions of the consortium are to provide to the defense secretary access to the expertise of the members of the consortium on matters relating to cybersecurity,” the legislative report states. “The consortium will align the efforts of consortia members in support of the Department of Defense and to act as a facilitator in responding to department requests relating to advice and assistance on matters relating to cybersecurity and to provide feedback to the secretary from members of the consortium.”
Senior Defense cyber leaders and academics kicked off the effort during a meeting at Ft. McNair in Washington. — SM
Army comes up with quick fix for email attachment issues
The Army is making digital life a little easier for soldiers by making it possible to download and send attachments in emails outside of a government network.
Raj Iyer, Army chief information officer, announced last week that after receiving complaints for employees, the service will be changing its policy.
“When we initially rolled out Army365 we were not ready to address the cybersecurity risks associated with allowing users to download/ upload files from your personal devices,” Iyer wrote on his LinkedIn page. “We now have a solution that we are currently implementing to enable you to do just that. Be on the watch for detailed instructions on Army365 in the next few days on how you can leverage this new functionality.”
Right now, soldiers can only access some files if they are using a government network, something that was particularly prohibitive for Reserve and National Guard members.
Iyer also teased some new pilots that soldiers can look forward to in the near future.
“We are getting ready to pilot bring your own device and Virtual Desktop Infrastructure that will tremendously enhance the user experience this year,” Iyer wrote. — SM",en,"Punishments, and first religious exemptions, for military vaccine refusers",CENTER,HIGH,,,
3192,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/air-force-members-denied-religious-exemptions-vaccine-file-lawsuit-stop-punishment-terminations,"A federal lawsuit has been filed on behalf of multiple Air Force service members seeking protections against punishment by the military after they were denied religious exemptions to the COVID-19 vaccine.
Fist Liberty Institute and law firm Schaerr Jaffe LLP filed the lawsuit against the Department of Defense and the Air Force on Friday afternoon on behalf of the service members, who represent about 2% of the Air Force members who have not been vaccinated against the coronavirus.
The filing alleges that the Department of Defense is violating the First Amendment rights of the service members by imposing a vaccine mandate that ""substantially burdens"" free exercise of religion, despite granting hundreds of administrative and medical exemptions. In addition, the lawsuit argues that the government does not have a compelling interest and has not provided service members other less restrictive manners in which to stop the spread of COVID-19.
""At a time of instability and ever-increasing threats around the world, you’d think the Pentagon would want every service member at their post. But instead, military leaders are forcing tens of thousands of our bravest out of the service because they’ve chosen to live according to their faith,"" First Liberty Institute's Mike Berry told Fox News Digital.
LAWSUIT FILED ON BEHALF OF NAVY SEALS FACING INTIMIDATION FOR SEEKING RELIGIOUS COVID-19 VACCINE EXEMPTIONS
""Punishing these servicemembers for seeking religious accommodation is illegal, vindictive, and wrong. Religious liberty is essential to national security, and our servicemembers deserve better.""
Danielle Runyan, an Air Force reserve member and one of the plaintiffs in the case, is also serving as counsel for First Liberty in this case. She is currently serving her two-week reserve duty, but faces involuntary separation after being denied religious accommodation to the vaccine.
She said in a statement to Fox News Digital: ""Like many servicemembers, I want to continue faithfully serving my country as I have proudly done for the past 10 years. As the Supreme Court has already recognized, ‘even in a pandemic, the Constitution cannot be put away and forgotten.’""
In March, the Supreme Court temporarily granted the Pentagon’s request to limit the deployment of unvaccinated active U.S. military members who refused to get COVID shots based on religious grounds.
The original lawsuit was brought by a group of 35 Navy SEALs and other Navy Special Warfare personnel. A lower court had granted a preliminary injunction to block the Pentagon from enforcing its vaccination policy.

3233,militarytimes.com,https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-army/2022/03/11/army-approves-first-religious-exemption-for-covid-vaccine/,"Army officials announced Friday that the service has approved its first religious exemption for the COVID-19 vaccine mandate, making it the final military service to approve such an accommodation.
“The Department of the Army has approved one religious accommodation,” confirmed Army spokesperson Lt. Col. Terry Kelley in an email to Army Times. “The Army determined the service member’s accommodation could be supported with no impact to mission readiness.”
The Marine Corps approved a handful of religious exemptions for Marines about to leave the service, and both the Navy and Air Force have approved a few as well.
Kelley said the service could not disclose any more information out of respect for the soldier’s privacy.

The vast majority of religious accommodation requests have been denied or are still awaiting decision, though, as the Army marches closer towards its goal of complete vaccination across the force.
As of Thursday, Kelley said, 97% of the active duty force has been vaccinated or began the shot series.
The Army is also yet to discharge any troops refusing the vaccine, despite announcing last month that discharges were beginning.

The Army National Guard and Army Reserve have not hit their vaccination deadline, which is June 30. The effective timeline for the Guard, though, could be impacted by ongoing litigation from governors who argue that the federal government cannot enforce the vaccine mandate on troops who are under state control.
The first religious exemption — and the continued lack of discharges — comes amid a flurry of lawsuits by members of other branches of the military who have argued that the Defense Department is not adequately considering their requests for religious accommodation.
The DoD’s inspector general is going to look into those claims, according to Military.com.
In some cases, judges have issued preliminary injunctions that have stopped the military from punishing certain groups of troops whose requests for accommodation have been denied.
One such servicemember is a Navy destroyer’s commanding officer, and the Navy is arguing in federal court that they cannot deploy the warship without removing him from command.

NAVY SEALS SEEKING RELIGIOUS EXEMPTIONS TO VACCINE MANDATE FACING INTIMIDATION AND HARASSMENT, SOURCES SAY
MIKE BERRY: Well, it all starts with the U.S. Constitution and the First Amendment, the free exercise of religion is enshrined in our Constitution as part of the bedrock foundation of this country and what our country was founded upon. And guess what? Not just the U.S. Constitution, but federal law and Department of Defense regulations themselves require the Department of Defense to honor religious freedom. We have regulations right now that say that religious accommodations should be granted and shall be granted and only in the most limited of circumstances the government has a very, very high bar that it has to meet in order to deny a religious accommodation. But we've been told from the Pentagon, from the very highest levels, that the DOD does not intend to approve any religious accommodation requests. And to my knowledge, and I've heard this from multiple sources, not a single religious accommodation has been approved at this point. And that's insane. That can't be the case. But yet that's that's exactly where we are.

3292,justthenews.com,https://justthenews.com/nation/religion/navy-quietly-rescinds-order-punishing-seals-religious-exemptions-covid-vax-mandate,"The Navy quietly rescinded an order to punish SEALs who sought religious exemptions to the military's COVID-19 vaccine mandate, recent court documents state.
On Sept. 24, 2021, Vice Chief of Naval Operations Admiral William Lescher issued ""Trident Order #12,"" which disqualified SEALs who sought religious exemptions from the COVID vaccine mandate from traveling for deployment, training, and conducting other standard business. According to the order, all special warfare forces were to initially comply with the vaccine mandate by mid-October 2021.
SEALs who refused ""to receive recommended vaccines based solely on personal or religious beliefs"" were ""medically disqualified,"" and thus, ""non-deployable.""
The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals placed the order on hold by issuing a preliminary injunction against it early this year in a lawsuit by 35 active-duty SEALs and three reservists who sought religious exemptions to the mandate.
A new filing in the lawsuit states that the order was quietly rescinded by the Navy on May 22, 2022, according to Fox News. However, the legal team representing the SEALs didn't learn of it until Sept. 1, over three months later.
A communication order on May 23 regarding the rescinded order said that Navy commands ""will continue to follow guidance, as appropriate, regarding COVID-19 vaccination, accommodation requests, and mitigation measures.""
It is not clear if the order has been replaced or what the reasoning behind rescinding it was, as the Navy declined to comment on ongoing litigation, Fox News reported.
""To the best of counsel's knowledge, Trident Order #12 was not replaced,"" the SEALs' legal team wrote in a new filing. ""As the Court will recall, Trident Order #12 stated that SEALs who are unvaccinated due to religious beliefs are medically disqualified, though SEALs who are unvaccinated due to medical reasons are not automatically disqualified. Trident Order #12 also implemented the COVID-19 vaccine mandate at the command level for Naval Special Warfare forces, setting a deadline of compliance for October 17, 2021.
""A copy of the order rescinding Trident Order #12 is attached to this letter. The rescission of Trident Order # 12 does not appear to affect the applicability of Navy or DoD-wide vaccine policies to NSW personnel—it just appears to remove the command-level direction.""
The lawsuit has been extended into a class action lawsuit for all Navy service members seeking religious exemptions to the vaccine mandate.
First Liberty's Senior Counsel and Director of Military Affairs Mike Berry, who represents the SEALs in the lawsuit, told Fox News, ""Now that the Navy has rescinded this unlawful order, the only reason it won't allow our SEALs to get back to doing their jobs is because of their religious beliefs.""
""America faces many national security threats, and the Navy is suffering a historic recruiting crisis.

3296,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/navy-chaplain-sailors-religious-exemption-covid-19-vaccine-mandate,"FIRST ON FOX: A chaplain in the U.S. Navy Reserve said Wednesday that the military is being used by the Biden administration as a ""nice little test group"" that ""can't say no"" after he said he was denied a religious exemption to the COVID-19 vaccine.
The chaplain, who spoke with Fox News Digital on the condition of anonymity, said he faces possible dismissal from the Navy after nearly two decades of service due to his refusal to get a vaccine.
He would miss out on crucial retirement pay and benefits if he's dismissed before hitting the 20-year mark.
MARINES’ CLAIM OF GRANTING 2 RELIGIOUS COVID-19 VACCINE EXEMPTIONS LEADS TO MORE QUESTIONS
""It’s a kick in the gut for sure,"" the chaplain said. ""If I lose retirement benefits that way, that would be a pretty significant burden to me and my family. At the same time, this is a fight worth fighting. I do not think this is a lawful order.""
""I know this chaplain, and he represents everything that is good about how our military balances the right of faith and the needs of a fighting force,"" California Republican Rep. Darrell Issa told Fox New Digital. ""That the Biden mandate is trampling him along with our soldiers on the front lines makes crystal clear how wrong all this is.""
The chaplain, who is also a pastor, said his religious exemption request was recommended for approval by his commanding officer and his commanding officer’s boss, but it was ultimately rejected ""at the top.""
""I was actually pleasantly surprised,"" he said. ""I thought my commander was going to be completely opposed to the request, but when I saw on the paperwork that he actually recommended approval and then his boss also recommended approval – I mean, to me, it's not about me, it's a big Navy thing. I think the commanders on the ground, many of them see this for what it is, but our hands are tied, and we have a lot of yes men at the top. It's really bad.""
In addition to discussions with chaplains to determine whether they have a ""sincerely held belief,"" troops must meet with commanders and medical personnel, and then the final decision is made higher up the chain of command. The Navy has not approved any of the thousands of requests for religious exemptions from the COVID-19 vaccine.
The rejection letter the chaplain received from Vice Admiral John B. Nowell Jr., provided to Fox News Digital, said, ""Your request for religious accommodation through waiver of immunization requirements is disapproved.""
""A waiver of immunizations would have a predictable and detrimental effect on your readiness and the readiness of the Sailors who serve alongside you in both operational and non-operational (including training) environments,"" the letter stated, in part. ""I find that disapproval of your request for a waiver of immunization requirements is the least restrictive means available to preserve the Department of Defense’s compelling interest in military readiness, mission accomplishment and the health and safety of military service members.
""The Navy is a specialized community governed by a discipline separate from that of the rest of society,"" the letter added. ""While every Sailor is welcome to express a religion of choice or none at all, our greater mission sometimes requires reasonable restrictions. You have my sincere best wishes for your continued success in your Navy career.""
The chaplain said the letter of rejection was nearly identical to the other letters he’s seen.
""You can hold each of these up to the light, and they look exactly like everyone else,"" he said.
The chaplain pointed to the U.S. Marine Corps, which recently approved religious accommodations for three Marines while rejecting thousands more.
MARINES SAY THEY’RE BEING ‘CRUSHED’ OVER VACCINE REFUSAL: ‘A POLITICAL PURGE’
One active-duty Marine with a legal background who recently spoke with Fox News Digital said the Corps granted those exemptions just to give the appearance that the religious rights of service members are being respected and to ""alleviate some of the pressure off of themselves."" That officer said, however, that the Corps has not disclosed exactly why those Marines’ requests were granted approval so that others can follow suit.
The officer said at least a ""dozen or so"" chaplains in the Marines have also been denied a religious exemption.
""That they're getting away with it just absolutely astounds me,"" the chaplain said. ""I would have thought that if you grant one, you have to grant everyone, because or else they are picking and choosing which religion is valid and who's Constitutional rights under the First Amendment will be honored and whose will not. It's offensive to me as someone who loves the Constitution.""
""The whole thing is shrouded in secrecy,"" he added.
The chaplain said he has filed an appeal and that it is still pending along with many others.
""Nobody knows quite what to do with us while we're waiting for all of these appeals to be adjudicated,"" he said. ""I am in limbo. I'm waiting to hear back on the appeal. Meanwhile, we're all sort of second-class citizens because we haven't had the jab.""
He said he believes service members are being used as ""test subjects"" with a vaccine that’s is still being studied.
""I honestly think that the push for 100% vaccination has to do with eliminating anything that looks like a control group,"" he said. ""I think that there's probably money involved somewhere. I think that the military has been a nice little test group, a set of test subjects that really can't say no.""
The CDC has repeatedly said that the vaccines are safe for use, and studies have shown that unvaccinated COVID patients are far more likely to die from the virus than vaccinated patients.

Last month, a federal judge in Texas granted a preliminary injunction stopping the Navy from acting against 35 sailors who refused on religious grounds to comply with the vaccine mandate. However, there was no indication that the order would affect service members beyond those 35 sailors.
Judge Reed O'Connor, in issuing the order, said, ""There is no COVID-19 exception to the First Amendment. There is no military exclusion from our Constitution.""

3375,libertynation.com,https://www.libertynation.com/the-militarys-war-on-vaccine-religious-exemption-requests/,"A U.S. Navy commander who is opposed to the military’s coronavirus vaccine mandate testified in a federal courtroom that he was treated with open hostility by his superior officers for pursuing a religious exemption. Rather than disavow such a climate of antipathy, a U.S. Justice Department lawyer instead asserted that the upper ranks had lost trust in the commander’s judgment due to his decision.

The telling exchange at a Feb. 10 hearing in Tampa sheds a light on the intense pressure sincerely religious Americans who want to serve their country are being made to feel, a burden being exacerbated by blatant distortions about the moral ground held by Christians who object to the jab due to its connection to abortion via fetal cell lines used in the production process. The Christians ‘Expressed Concern’
The Tampa Bay Times reported on the commander’s courtroom appearance, along with a Marine lieutenant colonel who also cites religious reasons for refusing any of the three COVID-19 vaccines produced by Johnson & Johnson, Moderna, and Pfizer.

“The pair testified anonymously, with a judge’s consent, to protect their identities,” the paper wrote. “Both described themselves as practicing Christians who believed that receiving vaccines would introduce impurities into their bodies. Each also expressed concern about fetal cell lines, which are used in the research and development of various vaccines and many common medicines. The military denied each of them a religious exemption to the vaccine requirement. Both could face discharge if they don’t comply.”

Note the subtly devious shading in the Times’ account. The fetal cell line objection is minimalized with the pro-vaccine staple talking point that “many common medicines” are produced via this research procedure. This argument is meaningless to an individual who believes abortion is murder and the harvesting of a murdered human being for research purposes is an abomination. The ubiquity of wrongdoing does not negate its evil in Christian theology. Both military officers testified that they are practicing Christians.

The “common practice” argument is almost always accompanied by an even more mendacious claim: that no major religion in the world opposes vaccines produced by such means. The Roman Catholic Church is the largest Christian denomination in the world. Its Congregation For the Doctrine of The Faith has specifically stated that Catholics have an absolute right to object to vaccines developed via abortion-related fetal-cell research and that secular authorities must respect this right. This is important to emphasize for it shows that individual practicing Christians do indeed have foundational moral standing for refusing the jab. It is not mere personal whim.

‘Pressured and Verbally Bullied’
The anonymous Naval commander told the Tampa courtroom 17 of the personnel aboard his ship had claimed a religious exemption to receiving the COVID-19 vaccines. “A chaplain investigated each and determined 16 were legitimate,” the Times reports. “He submitted his own religious exemption request in September, but it was denied. The 16 sailors on his ship who also claimed religious exemptions were also denied accommodations.” In November, he tested positive for the coronavirus. From the Times: “Over nearly two years, the commander said, about 170 to 180 of his ship’s personnel have come down with COVID-19 at some point. None have become seriously ill, he said.” From this point on, the commander says he became a marked man.

Brandi King, an Air Force Reserves lieutenant colonel, shared a similar story with The American Conservative. As soon as King revealed she was seeking a religious exemption to the vaccine “she was pressured and verbally bullied by her superior officers, who told her not to go through with this course of action,” the magazine states.

“There had been at least two weeks of harassment and bullying, as they were trying to get me not to file a religious accommodation request,” King told TAC. “I was basically told that my career would end, that I would get court-martialed, that I would be convicted under UCMJ [Uniform Code of Military Justice] Article 92, or Article 15, or all kinds of stuff.”

Critics of the military exemption process say such accounts prove that a heavy-handed culture of compliance is being meted out within the ranks, with no genuine space made for appeals of personal conscience. This is borne out by the Pentagon’s Orwellian wording on religious exemptions, issued in August.

“There is a religious exemption possibility for any mandatory vaccine, and there’s a process that we go through to counsel the individual both from a medical and from a command perspective about using a religious exemption,” Pentagon Press Secretary John F. Kirby is quoted as saying in a Defense Department news post. According to this DoD article, “Counseling, [Kirby] said, includes a discussion with both a medical professional and a commander about the risks of not being vaccinated as well as how not being vaccinated might affect deployability, assignments or travel. Requests for religious exemption differ by service.” The press secretary is further quoted as saying, “We take freedom of religion and worship seriously, in the military, it’s one of the things that we sign up to defend and so it’s something that’s done very carefully.” That description of “counseling” looms ominously over the nice words about “freedom of religion” that follow in its aircraft-carrier-size wake.

Kirby made it clear last summer that Christians seeking religious exemptions were to be subjected to therapeutic sessions in which the unpleasant consequences of their actions would be dangled before them. “We have every expectation that once the vaccines are made mandatory, the troops are going to … do the right thing,” Kirby icily adds in the Pentagon dispatch.

“The whole point of doing this is to do the right thing, primarily before God,” an active-duty major, who wished to remain anonymous, told The American Conservative.

3383,financialexpress.com,https://www.financialexpress.com/lifestyle/health/us-air-force-approves-9-religious-exemptions-for-covid-vaccine/2429088/,"The Air Force became the second military service to approve religious exemptions to the mandatory COVID-19 vaccine, granting requests from nine airmen to avoid the shots, officials said Tuesday.
The nine approved so far represent just a tiny fraction of the more than 6,400 requested by Air Force troops, and they come as other service members are challenging the lack of religious exemptions in court cases. The Marine Corps is the only other military service to grant any religious accommodations, allowing three so far. The Army and Navy have not approved any.
The services have come under criticism for their failure to grant religious exemptions, with members of Congress, the military and the public questioning if the review processes have been fair. All together, the services have received more than 14,000 requests for religious exemptions.
Military leaders have argued that religious exemptions to any of the many vaccines troops are required to get have been very rare over the years. Service members are required to get as many as 17 different vaccines, depending on where they deploy.A federal judge in Texas granted a preliminary injunction last month, stopping the Navy from acting against 35 sailors for refusing on religious grounds to comply with an order to get the COVID vaccine.
Eight of the Air Force approvals came during the initial review process, and one was granted on appeal to senior Air Force leaders. So far, religious exemption requests from more than 3,200 airmen were denied, and another 3,200 are pending.“The Department of the Air Force determined the service members’ accommodations could be supported with no impact to mission readiness,” the statement Tuesday said.
Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and military leaders have argued that the vaccine is critical to maintaining military readiness and the health of the force. And all of the services have now either discharged personnel for refusing the vaccine, or put a system in place to do so.
The Marine Corps has discharged 469, the Air Force has discharged 179 and the Navy has discharged 118, according to data released in the last week. The number include active-duty personnel and entry-level recruits who were still in boot camp. The Army has issued more than 3,000 formal letters of reprimand, and fired six soldiers, but has not discharged anyone yet.
All the military services have said the exemption decisions are based not only on the individual request, but also on its impact on the unit, its mission and readiness, and the health and safety of other troops.Those who get an exemption and are allowed to stay in the service may, however, see an impact on their jobs.
The Navy and the Marine Corps have said unvaccinated service members are not allowed to deploy out to sea on ships, where infections can more easily spread. Those who have approved exemptions — either medical, administrative or religious — are assigned to shore duties.

The Orlando-based religious freedom organization Liberty Counsel filed two renewed motions on Tuesday in U.S. District Court Middle District of Florida asking the court to certify the entire class and to issue a classwide preliminary injunction.
Liberty Counsel is representing Coast Guard members who argue taking the COVID-19 experimental vaccines violates their sincerely held religious beliefs because they were developed using aborted fetal cells. Its plaintiffs have received no religious exemptions or accommodations, which they filed for well in advance of vaccine compliance deadlines. The deadlines have since passed and disciplinary actions have begun. Relief from the court, Liberty Counsel argues, “is needed now to prevent these military heroes from facing discharge, court martial, other life-altering disciplinary procedures, and termination.”
Liberty Counsel Founder and Chairman Mat Staver said, “Even though these courageous Coast Guard heroes have been threatened with termination and separation, many were recently deployed to south Florida to rescue victims of Hurricane Ian. Not one person who was helped by these heroes was concerned whether they had received the COVID shot. Yet the Department of Defense continues to violate the law and ignore their religious freedom. This must end.”
Liberty Counsel made public the credentials of some of its plaintiffs.
One, a lieutenant commander pilot, has served honorably on active duty for over 13 years, according to Liberty Counsel. With more than 3,010 military flight hours and 234 simulator hours, the pilot has served in operational tours in Louisiana, Puerto Rico, and Alaska. He estimates the cost of his training to exceed $10 million and has received two commendation medals.
Another is an avionics electrical technician/petty officer first class who’s served for nearly 19 years, according to Liberty Counsel. As a navigator on HC-130H aircraft, he currently runs the training program and flight schedules at his air station, the only U.S. Coast Guard air station flying HC-130H aircraft. While there’s a shortage of navigators, and he’s the only navigator at his air station trained to perform his training function, the Coast Guard is willing to terminate him over a vaccine mandate after denying his religious exemption request, Liberty Counsel notes.
Another is a senior chief boatswain’s mate/senior chief petty officer in the Reserve who leads and mentors younger members, according to Liberty Counsel. With over 23 years of uninterrupted service and no disciplinary actions, his primary operational duties and responsibilities focus on safely operating and navigating multiple small craft.
The request with the court was filed after the Coast Guard issued a memorandum to all Coast Guard commands to initiate separation proceedings for all who refused to take the COVID-19 shots that said they violate their sincerely held religious beliefs.
It was also filed after a Department of Defense Office of Inspector General found that U.S. military officials violated federal law by issuing widespread denials of religious exemption requests.",en,More motions filed seeking class status for U.S. Coast Guard members denied vaccine religious exemption requests,RIGHT,,,,
3473,stripes.com,https://www.stripes.com/covid/2021-10-28/military-coronavirus-vaccine-mandate-religious-exemptions-chaplains-3408347.html,"WASHINGTON – Military chaplains say they are navigating a nuanced process of determining which service members get religious exemptions to avoid the mandated coronavirus vaccine as attorneys representing some troops contend their methods have led to unfair treatment in some cases.
Now as deadlines loom for all service members to get the vaccine, troops who are denied exemptions will be forced to choose between taking the shots or leaving the service. But measuring a person’s religious sincerity can be tricky, leaving some troops waiting anxiously for a decision, some chaplains and attorneys said.
While the religious-exemption processes are established in service doctrines, military chaplains said their role in the process is complicated. Chaplains must determine whether service members are truthful in their religious objections to the vaccine or simply using faith to avoid a shot they don’t want to take. It’s a case-by-case process that requires the chaplains to make recommendations to the chain of command.
“For those who are against the vaccine for religious reasons, the chaplains really determine the severity of their religious conviction,” said Navy Capt. Richard Ryan, the chaplain overseeing the service’s Pacific fleet. “The policy says it'll be on a case-by-case basis and it is based on the sincerity of the religious conviction.”
But some attorneys claim the case-by-case nature of the process leads to uneven treatment that derides military effectiveness by making social pariahs out of vaccine refusers.
“They can do this ad hoc treatment where some individuals are getting assistance from the command and others are being basically bullied and harassed,” said Houston attorney Sean Timmons, a former Army prosecutor who is representing some troops in this matter. “That's creating a lot of readiness issues because the unit's supposed to be a cohesive team to deploy together to fight a mission.”
The mandate, which Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin issued in August, requires all service members who refuse the shot without an approved medical, religious or other administrative exemption to be separated from the military for failing to obey a lawful order, according to the Pentagon.
There are several steps before separation, which include a series of consultations with commanders and medical professionals meant to address any misinformation about the vaccine, which the Food and Drug Administration approved for emergency use nearly a year ago. The FDA in August gave full approval to the Pfizer vaccine, which prompted Austin to issue the military mandate.
Austin called the vaccine “necessary to protect the force and defend the American people” in his Aug. 24 memo announcing the mandate.
“Mandatory vaccinations are familiar to all of our service members, and mission-critical inoculation is almost as old as the U.S. military itself,” he said.
The coronavirus has killed 71 service members, about half of whom died after the vaccine became available, according to the latest Defense Department data. Most were unvaccinated, though some vaccination statuses were not reported.
Despite some troops seeking exemptions, the services have reported high vaccination rates.
About 97% of active-duty troops have received at least one dose of the vaccine, though a fraction have submitted exemption requests for religious, medical or other administrative reasons. The rates for active-duty troops broken down by service are about 92% of the Marine Corps, 93% of the Army, 99% of the Navy and 98% of the Air Force and Space Force who are at least partially vaccinated, according to the services’ latest data.
“I think you can see from the numbers … there's not a lot of resistance,” Kirby told reporters Wednesday at the Pentagon. “People understand that this is an important program, and they're participating in it.”
Troops in the Air Force and Space Force must be fully vaccinated by Nov. 2, those in the Marine Corps and Navy by Nov. 28 and soldiers in the Army by Dec. 15, each service branch has announced separately.
Service leaders have declined to say how many exemption requests have been filed, though the Army, Navy and Marine Corps said no permanent religious exemptions so far had been approved. The Air Force, which also oversees the Space Force’s vaccine data, did not say whether any religious exemption requests by guardians or airmen have been approved.
While Austin has said vaccinating troops against the coronavirus is a matter of military readiness, chief Pentagon spokesman John Kirby on Monday said it is also important to allow troops an opportunity to request accommodations if the vaccine goes against their religious convictions.
""We want to respect people's religious beliefs in the military, and one of the freedoms that we fight for here in the military is religious freedom,"" he said. ""So in keeping with our values as an institution, [we] allow people who are concerned from a religious perspective to be able to state that perspective and to have that worked out.""
Complicated process
The military has an established protocol for handling exemption requests. While each branch has service-specific guidelines, the processes are largely the same: File an exemption request with the commanding officer, undergo a series of interviews with commanders, chaplains and doctors, then wait for a decision from the Pentagon to approve or deny the request.
Timmons said his office has helped secure a handful of exemption recommendations from commands at Fort Hood, Texas, and Fort Bragg, N.C. Those recommendations now are awaiting final approval by the Army secretary.
His colleagues have also helped some troops in the Navy, Marine Corps and Air Force, but Timmons could not say how many. None had received secretary-level approval yet.
“Each branch has to go to the office of the secretary of the service for final approval, so a lot of applications are sitting waiting [to be] finally approved by the secretary,” Timmons said.
But the judgment included in that process is anything but clear cut, he added.
“They’re trying to ‘determine if individuals have a sincere religious conviction that's causing them to be opposed morally to vaccination,’ but how do you judge somebody's religious sincerity?” he asked. “That's really subjective. There's not really an objective way to do that.”
To answer that question, the military turns to its chaplains, who have been tasked with interviewing exemption requestees to help commanders and other decisionmakers understand whether a claim is true.
“Sincerely held religious beliefs are hard to judge by someone else, so you kind of have to go by that person’s conviction,” Ryan said.
Religious freedom is protected by the First Amendment, and the services traditionally have allowed some accommodations to honor religious beliefs, such as allowing female Muslim troops to wear hijabs in uniform.
With the coronavirus vaccine, some Christians, for example, have objected to accepting shots tested on laboratory-grown cells that descended from fetal cells aborted decades earlier, according to Eve Schatelowitz, an attorney based in Round Rock, Texas. The vaccines themselves contain no aborted fetal cells, according to the FDA.
That issue complicates the sincerity determination for chaplains when the same service members objecting to the coronavirus vaccine for fetal-cell reasons did not object to other military-mandated vaccines that used the same process, such as the chickenpox and hepatitis A vaccines.
“Can you say, ‘I have a sincerely held religious belief against the [coronavirus] vaccine, but I'm OK taking every other vaccine’?” Ryan asked. “I don't know, can you do that? It’s a case-by-case basis.”
Fairness concerns
Timmons said the case-by-case process can cause fairness issues. Among his clients, he said he’s seen a pattern of those who are well liked by their command having an easier time securing the exemptions than those who are not.
“The reality is they're helping those who they think are top performers, and everybody else, they’re browbeating them and putting them under duress, and if they don't comply … they're moving to separate [them],” he said.
Timmons, who is vaccinated, said he’s seen his “clients inflicted with significant harassment -- being admonished, being mocked, being bullied, being ostracized” by their chain of command for refusing to get the shot.
For example, he said some troops were told to “sit in the corner” after declining the shot at command-ordered mass vaccination events, which is “a way to mock those individuals who aren't complying with directives to get vaccinated.”
“They look like kids in a classroom back in the ‘80s when it used to be that the ones who talk too much were put in the corner of the room to prevent them from talking,” Timmons said.
Kirby on Wednesday told reporters that he was unaware of reports of unfair treatment regarding vaccine exemptions, adding Austin expects “leaders throughout the department are going to handle the mandatory vaccination program with compassion and with understanding.”
“There’s an exemption policy that’s been in place well before the [coronavirus] vaccine. It's not new,” Kirby said. “And [Austin’s] expectation is that if members of the military want to apply for one that they should be able to, and they should be able to make their case.”
Determining sincerity
While there’s no standardized Defense Department script that chaplains must use to determine religious convictions, some commands have developed key questions to ask.
For example, a religious accommodation interview questionnaire used by the Army Chaplain Corps asks questions such as “How does your religion influence and shape your lifestyle?” and “How is your religious practice burdened by military regulation?”
Schatelowitz, who is helping her Greek Orthodox son through the Army’s exemption process, advises troops seeking exemptions to know and study their religious beliefs before starting the request process.
“In order to show sincerity, you're going to have to know what you're talking about,” she said.
Schatelowitz said those seeking waivers should at least know the basic tenets of the religion and why receiving the vaccine violates one’s religious convictions.
“If you just walk in and go, ‘Hey, you know, this is against my religion,’ they’re not going to believe you,” she said. “You basically have to convince them and the only way you can convince people of anything is if you know your position inside and out.”
‘Belief of the individual’
Religious beliefs don’t necessarily have to align with what an established church or religion teaches about the vaccine, Ryan said.
For example, Pope Francis has said taking the vaccine is “an act of love” and consistent with the Catholic faith, but that doesn’t nullify a Catholic service member’s claim that it goes against his or her beliefs to receive the vaccine.
“It’s not just about what the denomination thinks – it’s the belief of the individual,” Ryan said. “You can be Catholic and disagree with the Catholic Church on that and it’s still a sincerely held religious belief.”
Believers also do not have to be affiliated with an established, mainstream religion or denomination to qualify for exemption. For example, Ryan said if an individual claimed the Holy Spirit told them not to receive a vaccine, that belief could also be enough to grant a religious exemption if a chaplain is convinced of the service member’s sincerity.
“It’s still a sincerely held belief [and] it qualifies to be processed under that religious accommodation waiver,” he said. “Now I’m not saying that guarantees the waiver.”
Within days until the first vaccine deadline, Schatelowitz said interested troops need to file religious exemption requests as soon as possible. Contacting an attorney is not required, but it can help, she said.
“I don't think it's a situation where people should just say, ‘Well, I'm never going to get it so I shouldn't try,’” Schatelowitz said. “I think a person should try, but they have got to be very sincere.”",en,Religious exemptions for the coronavirus vaccine examined case by case by military chaplains as deadlines approach for troops to get the shots,CENTER,HIGH,HIGH CREDIBILITY,,
3688,harbingersdaily.com,https://harbingersdaily.com/federal-judge-issues-emergency-injunction-us-military-systematically-denying-religious-exemptions/,"A federal judge in Tampa has issued a temporary restraining order against the U.S. military, saying the Department of Defense is unlawfully discriminating against service members by denying religious exemptions for COVID-19 shots.
U.S. District Judge Steven Merryday issued the restraining order for two service members pending a hearing as a result of Liberty Counsel’s request for an emergency injunction in Navy SEAL 1 v. Biden. Liberty Counsel is a Christian religious rights law firm representing the two unnamed officers.
According to court documents, one plaintiff is identified as U.S. Marine Corps Lieutenant Colonel 2 whose appeal for a religious exemption from the COVID shot was denied. On Feb. 2, she was to be added to the Officer Disciplinary Notebook, beginning the
Board of Inquiry Process and her command selection withdrawn, irreparably damaging her career. This officer would have been ultimately discharged from the Marine Corps.
The second plaintiff, a U.S. Navy Command Surface Warfare Officer, was denied a religious exemption from the COVID shot and faced immediate discipline when he would have been removed from command as captain of his ship, irreparably damaging his career.
“The record in this action establishes that the two service members are very likely to prevail on their claim that their respective branch of the military has wrongfully denied a religious exemption from COVID-19 vaccination,” Judge Merryday wrote. “The record creates a strong inference that the services are discriminatorily and systematically denying religious exemptions without a meaningful and fair hearing and without the showing required under RFRA (while simultaneously granting medical exemptions and permitting unvaccinated persons to continue in service without adverse consequence).”
In his court order, Merrydaty prohibitedSecretary of Defense Lloyd Austin “from diminishing or altering in any manner and for any reason the current status of Navy Commander and Lieutenant Colonel, including their assignment, privileges, rank, or the like. In short, Navy Commander and Lieutenant Colonel must remain ‘as is’ throughout the duration of this injunctive relief until Feb. 11.”
Liberty Counsel Founder and Chairman Mat Staver said, “The court acknowledges that while the military is allowing unvaccinated service members with medical exemptions, it is unlawfully denying religious exemptions. Yesterday’s order is a positive step toward finally putting an end to this abuse of the law and of our military personnel.”
US Military Only Granted 3 Religious Exemptions Out of 22,951 Requests
The judge previously ordered each branch of the military to file a detailed report regarding religious exemptions from the COVID-19 shot every 14 days beginning Friday, January 7, 2022. The filings received by the court as of January 21, 2022, show that out of 22,951 religious exemption requests received, only three were granted, and those were questionable since at least two of those service members were already scheduled to leave the military.
However, 3,449 medical exemptions have been granted. The reports confirm the military continues to deny religious exemptions while granting medical exemptions.
Liberty Counsel attorneys are scheduled to return to the U.S. District Court in Tampa for a hearing on Thursday, Feb. 10 to extend this emergency injunction and to obtain the same relief for all the military plaintiffs.
The law firm represents plaintiffs from five branches of the military, federal employees, and federal civilian contractors who have been unlawfully mandated to get the COVID shots or face punishment and discharge from the military or termination from employment.
While the current order applies to two of the many military plaintiffs due to the immediate harm, the lawsuit includes members from all branches of the military and also requests class certification to cover every member whose religious exemptions have been denied.
As CBN News has previously reported, a growing number of U.S. service members say the military is stripping them of their religious liberties. Many of the COVID-19 vaccination deadlines for active-duty members have passed without a single religious exemption being granted. This has led several service members to file federal lawsuits against the Biden administration.
On Feb. 3, the Army announced it would immediately begin discharging soldiers who have refused to get the mandatory COVID-19 vaccine, putting more than 3,300 service members at risk of being discharged soon.
The Army’s announcement makes it the final military service to layout its discharge policy for vaccine refusers. The Marine Corps, Air Force, and Navy have already discharged active-duty troops or entry-level personnel at boot camps for refusing the shots.
In December, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby admitted to CBN News that religious exemptions are rare. For example, none have been granted in either the Navy or Marines in almost a decade.
“This is not about liberties, it’s about a military medical requirement to keep them safe, to keep their families safe, to keep their units safe and the Secretary continues to strongly believe that these vaccines are the best way to do it with respect to COVID,” Kirby said.
A Navy spokesman also told CBN News at the time there is no “blanket policy” about denying religious exemption requests. Each is reportedly considered on a case-by-case basis. There are, however, very strict guidelines that must be met, including a history of objecting to vaccinations. Anyone who refuses to get vaccinated, Christian or not, will be given a general discharge.
But according to a formal complaint brought by an anonymous Navy officer to the chief of naval operations, the lengthy review process is just for show. CLICK HERE FOR

“Under the Biden administration, religious exemption is a sham,” Family Research Council tweeted, pointing to an article, written by the organization’s President Tony Perkins, ”Freedom on Furlough: Biden Ousts Military’s Unvaxxed.”
Perkins wrote:
Just how anti-freedom is the Biden administration? Even a military chaplain can’t get a religious exemption! In an astonishing story, a Navy reservist complained to Fox News that his vaccine accommodation was denied — even though he had his two commanders’ approval. “That they’re getting away with it just absolutely astounds me,” the chaplain said on the condition of anonymity.
The Navy chaplain, who stands to lose his 20 years of retirement benefits over the dispute, said, “I would have thought that if you grant one, you have to grant everyone — or else they are picking and choosing which religion is valid and whose constitutional rights under the First Amendment will be honored and whose will not. It’s offensive to me as someone who loves the Constitution.”
The message is simple: the Biden Pentagon doesn’t care about the religious freedom of their men and women in uniform. “It’s unfortunate that they’re more concerned with 100 percent vaccine compliance than they are with 100 percent Constitution compliance,” [First Liberty Institute’s Justin Butterfield] lamented. That has to change. If it doesn’t, this president will have to answer to the people — and the courts.

However, Paul emphasized that these things were not to come at the expense of “fedelity,” meaning their conviction of truth and faithfulness to Biblical teachings.
Titus‬ ‭2:9-10‬ ‭KJV‬‬ – “Exhort servants to be obedient unto their own masters, and to please them well in all things; not answering again; not purloining, but shewing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.” (emphasis added)

The nine approved so far represent just a tiny fraction of the more than 6,400 requested by Air Force troops, and they come as other service members are challenging the lack of religious exemptions in court cases. The Marine Corps is the only other military service to grant any religious accommodations, allowing three so far. The Army and Navy have not approved any.
The services have come under criticism for their failure to grant religious exemptions, with members of Congress, the military and the public questioning if the review processes have been fair. All together, the services have received more than 14,000 requests for religious exemptions.
Military leaders have argued that religious exemptions to any of the many vaccines troops are required to get have been very rare over the years. Service members are required to get as many as 17 different vaccines, depending on where they deploy.
A federal judge in Texas granted a preliminary injunction last month, stopping the Navy from acting against 35 sailors for refusing on religious grounds to comply with an order to get the COVID vaccine.
Eight of the Air Force approvals came during the initial review process, and one was granted on appeal to senior Air Force leaders. So far, religious exemption requests from more than 3,200 airmen were denied, and another 3,200 are pending.
“The Department of the Air Force determined the service members’ accommodations could be supported with no impact to mission readiness,” the statement Tuesday said.
Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and military leaders have argued that the vaccine is critical to maintaining military readiness and the health of the force. And all of the services have now either discharged personnel for refusing the vaccine, or put a system in place to do so.

The Marine Corps has discharged 469, the Air Force has discharged 179 and the Navy has discharged 118, according to data released in the last week. The number include active-duty personnel and entry-level recruits who were still in boot camp. The Army has issued more than 3,000 formal letters of reprimand, and fired six soldiers, but has not discharged anyone yet.

The Navy and the Marine Corps have said unvaccinated service members are not allowed to deploy out to sea on ships, where infections can more easily spread. Those who have approved exemptions — either medical, administrative or religious — are assigned to shore duties.

The lawsuit, which names Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall as a defendant, alleges that the service employs a double standard when approving exemption requests that favors medical and administrative exemptions.

The plaintiffs are asking the court to declare the mandate unconstitutional, and bar the Air Force from taking ""enforcement/punitive action"" against them while the case is underway.
""The Department of the Air Force has failed to approve all but a small handful of religious accommodation requests, and those requests, upon information and belief, are for airmen who are close to the terminal end of their service,"" reads the complaint.
""While at the same time, the Department of the Air Force has approved thousands of administrative or medical exemptions to the same requirements,"" it continues.
An Air Force spokesperson told The Hill that the service is aware of the filings, but doesn't comment on pending litigation.
The lawsuit, which was filed on Feb. 16, came a day after a federal judge in Georgia blocked the Air Force from booting a service member who had religious objections to the vaccine.
Active-duty service members had until Nov. 2 to be vaccinated, while Air National Guard and Reservists were given until Dec. 31.
The Air Force first said on Feb. 8 that it granted nine service members religious exemptions from the vaccine mandate. According to data released Tuesday, the service has approved 13 religious exemptions from the vaccine requirement.
The plaintiffs, which include a group of officers and reservists, all say they spoke with a military chaplain to verify the sincerity of their beliefs, but they were still denied.
Some of them also say they had natural immunity from previous infections with COVID-19.
""The granting of more than one thousand medical and administrative exemptions belies any assertion that vaccination is mission-critical and that no exemptions can be granted,"" reads the complaint.
Across the military, the services receive thousands of requests for religious exemptions but have only approved a small number.
The Marine Corps which was the first service grant religious exemptions to the mandate in mid-January, disclosed on Thursday that it has granted six out of over 3,600 requests it has received.
The Navy has also said it conditionally granted one religious accommodation for a member of its Individual Ready Reserve, but that person will have to be vaccinated before returning to active service.

Federal law and policies require individualized reviews
Read the IG's memo at the end of this post
In a landmark finding, the Inspector General (IG) for the Defense Dept. has found that the Pentagon has been illegally issuing blanket denials of Covid-19 vaccine religious exemptions.
Federal law and policies require individualized reviews and consideration of such applications made by military troops. But the IG found no such reviews were provided.
Instead, the IG says, religious exemption applications have been met with wholesale denials without meaningful reviews.
The IG says its hotline received ""dozens of complaints"" about the problem. The IG's review found that ""the volume and rate at which decisions were made to deny requests is concerning."" According to the findings, approximately 4,500 requests for exemptions were denied in one three month period.
Courts have issued injunctions to stop mandatory Covid-19 vaccination in all military branches except the Coast Guard and Army, according to attorney R. Davis Younts. Younts represents a number of military clients, and recently won a determination that it is unlawful for the military to mandate the current experimental Covid-19 vaccine that is not a formulation that received FDA approval. However, there are reports of forced vaccination among troops still being carried out, under threat of dismissal.
Military Covid vaccine mandates continue to be on the books despite the fact that CDC has now conceded those who have had Covid should be treated the same as those who are vaccinated. Numerous scientific studies have found that natural immunity through infection is more enduring and effective than the vaccines, which have turned out to prevent neither infection nor illness. Additionally, scientists say young and healthy people are at extremely low risk of serious illness from Covid. But the vaccines are reported to elevate a myriad of risks, including heart issues among young people.
Reasons for religious exemption requests vary, says Younts. They include the objection that some Covid vaccine development used cells from aborted human fetuses.
(T)he volume and rate at which decisions were made to deny requests is concerning... an average of 50 denials per day were processed over a 90-day period. Assuming a 10-hour work day with no breaks or attention to other matters, the average review period was about 12 minutes for each package. Such a review period seems insufficient to process each request in an individualized manner..."" Defense Dept. Inspector General
Despite the IG's findings, there is no public indication the Defense Dept. has taken steps to follow the law or correct the allegedly unlawful exemption denials.

Acting Inspector General Sean O’Donnell sent a memo to Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin while the department continued to defend its position in court and as branches of the military sought to dishonorably discharge, punish and even evict from their housing service members who were in noncompliance with the vaccine mandate Austin issued last August. O’Donnell’s June 2 memo also surfaced after federal judges have increasingly issued blistering rebukes of military leaders when granting class action status for plaintiffs in lawsuits filed in several states. The memo was issued after the OID performed an audit of the U.S. military branches’ processing of COVID-19 exemption requests for active-duty service members to determine if they were in compliance with federal law and U.S. military regulations. The OIG found that they weren’t. O’Donnell told Austin he was writing to inform him of “potential noncompliance with standards for reviewing and documenting the denial of religious accommodation requests of Service members identified through complaints submitted to my office.” He said the DOD’s hotline received dozens of complaints from service members and his office found “a trend of generalized assessments rather than the individualized assessment that is required by Federal law and DoD and Military Service policies.” He points out that blanket denial memorandums given to service members from the Air Force and the Navy didn’t “reflect an individualized analysis, demonstrating that the Senior Military Official considered the full range of facts and circumstances relevant to the particular religious accommodation request.” Instead, they included “similar, if not identical, wording,” following an example like one given in the Air Force: “I disapprove your request for exemption from vaccinations under the provisions of AFI 48-110, paragraph 2-6.b.3.” The Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 prohibits the government from substantially burdening a person’s exercise of religion unless it “demonstrates that application of the burden to the person is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest and is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest,” O’Donnell argues. U.S. Military code requires officials to review each request individually, “considering the full range of facts and circumstances relevant to the specific request,” O’Donnell wrote. “The means that is least restrictive to the requestor’s religious practice and that does not impede a compelling governmental interest will be determinative.” He also said, “the volume and rate at which decisions were made to deny requests is concerning.” An average of 50 denials were issued a day, the OIG’s office found, in a more than 90-day period. “Assuming a 10-hour workday with no breaks or attention to other matters, the average review period was about 12 minutes” for each appeal submitted by a service member, he notes, which he says is “insufficient.” The OIG’s findings were consistent with those of a federal judge in a lawsuit filed by the Orlando-based religious freedom organization, Liberty Counsel, in Navy SEAL 1 v. Biden (now Austin). In February, Judge Steven Merryday ordered each branch of the military to report the status of religious exemptions filed every 14 days beginning January 7, 2022. By February 4, of the 24,818 religious exemption requests received, only four were granted. Liberty Counsel Founder and Chairman Mat Staver said, “The Biden administration and the Department of Defense are violating federal law by denying the religious free exercise rights of service members from the COVID shot mandate. Our service members swear an oath to defend the U.S. Constitution. Their oath to defend the Constitution and their willingness to give their lives for our freedom must not be illusory. The abuse must end.” U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Georgia Judge Tilman Self, III, also said earlier this year that the Air Force’s claim that it was providing a religious accommodation process, “proved to be nothing more than a quixotic quest for Plaintiff because it was ‘by all accounts, . . . theater.’” Self calculated the percentage of religious exemption requests the Air Force granted was 0.24%. In another case, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals handed the Biden administration another blow when it upheld a ruling by a federal district court judge who granted class certification for all members of the Air Force. “The Department of Defense’s Covid vaccine mandate is deleterious to readiness and the military’s ability to fight and win wars,” they argue. “The vaccine provides negligible benefit to the young, fit members of our Armed Forces, and the mandate’s imposition is clearly affecting the Department’s ability to sustain combat formations and recruit future talent.” Austin has not issued a public response to the memo or replied to the requests of the members of Congress. He and his administration maintain the mandate is imperative for mission readiness and have steadfastly defended their position in court. His administration has also argued that federal district judges don’t have jurisdiction to rule on military cases, an argument they’ve consistently lost.",en,Inspector General: Denying religious exemptions to service members who refuse COVID-19 vaccines violates federal law,RIGHT,,,,
3953,justthenews.com,https://justthenews.com/government/courts-law/coast-guardsmen-denied-religious-exemptions-covid-vax-mandate-after-commander,"Three Coast Guard officers have filed a class action lawsuit against the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security after they were denied religious exemptions from the COVID-19 vaccine mandate.
The Coast Guard officers received awards and approval from commanders while remaining unvaccinated. They are seeking both a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction against the dismissal of 1,200-plus unvaccinated members.
The lawsuit, Stone et al. v. Mayorkas et al., was filed Friday in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas by the Thomas More Society on behalf of the Coast Guardsmen.
The plaintiffs include Lieutenant Junior Grade Alaric Stone, who was the top graduate in the Class of 2020 at the Coast Guard Academy; Non-Commissioned Officer Eric Jackson, who has been in the Coast Guard for 18 years and received an award this year for his exemplary service; and Lieutenant Junior Grade Michael Marcenelle, who received the Coast Guard Achievement Medal for his superior performance the past three years on the same day he was reprimanded for his religious accommodation request (RAR) for an exemption from the vaccine mandate.
Stone's supervising officer called him an ""Exemplary Officer [who] embodies critical leadership skills"" while praising his ""commitment to core values,"" and gave the ""highest recommendation"" for him in future at-sea tours despite his RAR already being denied, according to the Thomas More Society.
Jackson's commander gave an official statement that his RAR posed ""no hindrance to operations"" or ""mission readiness.""
""These exemplary Coast Guard officers ... are being rewarded for their documented stellar service by dismissal,"" Thomas More Society Senior Counsel Stephen Crampton said in a statement. ""That is both immoral and illegal.
""This lawsuit seeks to stop the government's religious discrimination against these, and all members of the Coast Guard, and to prevent their discharge from the military, which has been initiated solely because they are as loyal to their faith as they have been to this nation.""
According to the lawsuit, the only RARs that have been approved were for Guardsmen who were already in the separation process or were retiring.
The lawsuit also alleges that the denials were blanket, which is contrary to the individualized assessments required by law.
In the filing, the Thomas More Society cites a Defense Department inspector general's report that ""found a trend of generalized assessments"" with regard to the denied religious exemptions. The government has ""taken no action to remedy the unlawful activity the Inspector General found,"" according to the lawsuit, despite the report and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin forwarding it to military branch leaders on Sept. 2.
""The Coast Guard has also ignored the latest Centers for Disease Control prevention guidelines, which recommend no longer differentiating based on a person's vaccination status,"" Crampton added. ""At the same time it is forcing these brave and principled service members out, the Coast Guard admits it faces an urgent shortfall in personnel and recruiting. The actions of both the government and the Coast Guard in this situation are ridiculous as well as illogical.""
The lawsuit comes as President Joe Biden said in an interview aired Sunday on CBS' ""60 Minutes"" that ""the pandemic is over.""
George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley wrote an article on Monday explaining how Biden's statement ""is likely to be cited in a variety of briefs in cases challenging emergency powers and policies used by the Administration.""
Biden's declaration will likely have an effect on the lawsuit against the vaccine mandate for federal workers, which is to be heard before the entire Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, Turley added.
Biden's statement ""will likely be cited in any balancing of religious rights against military discipline and order"" in cases involving religious exemptions to the military vaccine mandate, Turley told Just the News on Monday.
The Coast Guard lawsuit follows the service's efforts to discharge members refusing the vaccine without allowing them to appear before administrative separation boards to defend their cases.
Last month, the Coast Guard Academy forced unvaccinated cadets whose RARs were denied off campus and sent them home while keeping them enrolled. The cadets are unable to attend classes or leave the academy for work elsewhere, and were not given any further details regarding their future in the service.

3971,military.com,https://www.military.com/daily-news/2022/02/16/judge-temporarily-blocks-vaccine-mandate-air-force-officer-seeking-religious-exemption.html,"A federal judge in Georgia on Tuesday blocked the Air Force from requiring an officer to get the COVID-19 vaccine, marking the first case where a court successfully blocked the mandate for an airman.
The airman, a woman who has served in the military for 25 years and works at Robins Air Force Base, Georgia, was not named in court documents. The officer's request for a religious exemption, based on the idea that some vaccine testing was done on fetal cell lines, was denied late last year.
In January, the Air Force officer filed a lawsuit against the service in the United States Court for the Middle District of Georgia. She is being represented by attorneys from the Thomas More Society, a conservative law firm based in Chicago.

Judge Tilman E. Self granted a preliminary injunction, temporarily stopping the Air Force from enforcing the mandate on the officer, writing in the court order that the airman's religious liberty should be paramount.
""All Americans, especially the Court, want our country to maintain a military force that is powerful enough to thoroughly destroy any enemy who dares to challenge it,"" Self wrote. ""However, we also want a military force strong enough to respect and protect its service members' constitutional and statutory religious rights. This ruling ensures our armed services continue to accomplish both.""
The injunction covers only the Air Force officer and does not grant a widespread injunction for other airmen or service members.
The Georgia preliminary injunction follows at least two high-profile cases filed in court districts within conservative-leaning states .
Early in January, a federal judge in Texas ordered the Navy and Defense Department to halt disciplinary procedures against 35 members of the service's special operations community for refusing to take a COVID-19 vaccine.
Another federal judge in Florida stopped the Navy from removing a commander and a Marine lieutenant colonel from their jobs earlier this month. In that court filing, the Air Force confirmed it had granted its first set of religious exemptions, before announcing them publicly several days later.
Mark Zaid, a Washington, D.C.-based attorney who fought and prevailed over the military's last major vaccine mandate for anthrax, told Military.com last week that it's likely many of these cases will be settled between the respective service branches and the plantiffs.
""It's so few people involved ... it wouldn't surprise me, at the end of the day, that something is worked out so that these cases don't continue and these guys don't take the shots,"" Zaid said. ""Maybe they're just put somewhere else in sort of a compromise.""
News of the airman's temporary victory comes after the Air Force granted its first handful of religious exemptions last week and as other court cases file in for individual injunctions.
As of Feb. 14, the Air Force had administratively separated 160 active-duty airmen for declining to get inoculated, while 96% of the service had been fully vaccinated against COVID-19.
Additionally, the force has approved eight religious exemptions and one appeal has been successful, according to the latest Air Force data.
It's not yet clear whether any of these cases looking to block the implementation of the COVID-19 vaccine mandate will change the military's policy.
Refusers, such as the Georgia Air Force officer, state that the use of fetal cell lines in the creation of the vaccine is a point of contention for those with strict religious stances against abortion.
The Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines do not need fetal cell lines for development or production but were tested on fetal cell lines replicated from an aborted fetus in the 1970s to ensure their efficacy. Only the Johnson & Johnson vaccine is made using fetal cell lines.
Notably, the measles, mumps and rubella, or MMR, vaccine is standard for military service and is made by growing the rubella virus inside fetal cells.
Lawyers for the Thomas More Society said they believe their lawsuit may have put pressure on the Air Force to start approving religious exemptions.
""The Air Force had granted over 1,500 medical exemptions by the time we filed this lawsuit, but not a single religious exemption -- not one,"" Stephen Crampton, senior counsel with the Thomas More Society, said in a press release. ""After we filed, it suddenly decided to start granting or claiming to grant religious exemptions, albeit only a handful.""
The law firm said in the press release that the Air Force officer is not a risk to other airmen because ""she has already had COVID-19 and twice tested positive for the antibodies in the year following her recovery"" and also follows social distancing measures. Research has shown that, while natural immunity does provide some protection against COVID-19 infection, vaccination reduces the risk of contracting the illness for both those who have gotten the coronavirus and those who haven't.
After the Air Force announced the first batch of religious exemptions, the service did not clarify whether those approved were already on their way out of the ranks.
""The Department of the Air Force determined the service members' accommodations could be supported with no impact to mission readiness,"" spokeswoman Ann Stefanek said in an emailed statement.
The Marine Corps made headlines last month when it became the first military branch to grant three religious exemptions, but all three went to Marines who were functionally no longer serving.

Most of the troops who have seen their applications for religious exemptions from the U.S. military’s COVID-19 vaccine mandate denied were deemed by a chaplain to have a “sincere belief,” which may lead a federal judge to block the mandate for them.
Article by Zachary Stieber from our premium news partners at The Epoch Times.
One hundred percent of the religious exemption requests that have been denied by the Marine Corps. and the Coast Guard were based on a sincere belief, according to chaplains, branch officials said in recent court filings obtained by The Epoch Times.
Approximately 92 percent of the requests denied by the Army were designated by the interviewing chaplain as being based on a sincerely held religious belief or without evidence that the applicant’s stated reasons were not sincere, according to Col. Kevin Mahoney, an official with the Office of the Army Surgeon General and U.S. Army Medical Command.
Shockingly, most precious metals companies who sponsor “conservative” news outlets are donating to Democrats and/or working with proxies of the CCP. We have found three companies that do not. You can find all three on our precious metals page.
The disclosures show top military officials have overruled chaplains in over 3,800 cases.
The number “confirms what many of us suspected, which is that the procedure for service members to submit religious exemption requests is basically bogus,” Jay Richards, a senior research fellow in the Heritage Foundation’s DeVos Center for Religion and Civil Society, told The Epoch Times.
The judge overseeing the case ordered the military to start Jan. 7 detailing how many of the denied requests were judged by chaplains to be sincere, and the latest figures were reported on Jan. 21.
Navy and Air Force officials have defied the order, stating in exhibits that it is “UNKNOWN” how many of the denied requests—the Navy has rejected 3,573 and the Air Force has denied 2,740—came in cases where the chaplains made that determination.
The case was brought by Liberty Counsel on behalf of military members who said they had been denied religious exemptions and were either punished or threatened with punishment before or after the denials.
Lawyers asked the court to block the enforcement of the military’s mandate against the plaintiffs.
U.S. District Court Judge Steven Merryday, a George H.W. Bush nominee, turned down the request, but said it was “quite plausible” that the military’s procedures for religious exemptions “is a ruse that will result inevitably in the undifferentiated (and therefore unlawful under RFRA) denial of each service member’s request.”
At the time of the ruling, in November 2021, the military had granted zero religious exemption requests. As of Jan. 29, only one branch, the Marines, had granted any.
Merryday ordered the military to produce figures outlining how officials were handling religious exemption applications and kept open the possibility of ultimately ruling in favor of the plaintiffs.
Matthew Staver, founder and chairman of Liberty Counsel, said the judge should have entered the injunction last year, but with the new disclosures, he will likely act.
“He said our arguments were plausible. But I think what he was wanting to do is get more data to confirm that and force the military to reveal the true data. Now that he has received that, I think we’ll get the injunction across the board. Because everything that we said was true,” Staver told The Epoch Times.
At the heart of the case is the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), which protects religious liberty under the First Amendment by preventing the government from placing a “substantial burden on a person’s exercise of religion.” The Pentagon uses the law’s standard to guide its process for accommodating military members’ religious practice.
Plaintiffs say their exercise of religion compels them not to get a COVID-19 vaccine, despite the order requiring vaccination. Defendants have said they’re properly considering and adjudicating each request, which begins with a chaplain and is sent to various officials, depending on the branch.
“At every step, each accommodation request is given full consideration with respect to the facts and circumstances submitted in the request. In each case, every reviewer weighs the compelling government interest against the individual’s request and the circumstances of their situation,” a Marines spokesman told The Epoch Times in an email, adding that the interest includes military readiness and health and safety.
“Religious accommodation requests include interviews with the Soldier’s chaplain, recommendations from the chain of command, as well as a public health and a legal review. For privacy reasons, we cannot comment on specific exemption requests,” an Army spokesman added.
A Navy spokesman declined to comment, citing pending litigation. The Air Force did not respond to a request for comment. Coast Guard spokespersons have refused to answer recent questions about how the branch handles exemption requests.
Philip Cave, a military lawyer with Cave & Freeburg LLP, told The Epoch Times that in his view, the military doesn’t need to grant any religious exemptions to the mandate.
“It’s my professional opinion that it’s a lawful order and that there are substantial health and mission and national security reasons for enforcement of the order, despite the RFRA,” he said.
Richards, though, said court precedent means service members retain their First Amendment rights after joining the military, which means the military has to respect their religious beliefs.
“I would find it extraordinary if the courts determined that members of the military had no right to religious exemption requests under any circumstance,” he said.
The case, which was filed in federal court in Florida, is ongoing. In a separate case, a federal judge in Texas blocked enforcement of the mandate against a group of Navy SEALs who were denied religious exemptions, ruling that the Navy rightly provides a religious exemption process “but by all accounts, it is theater.”

On September 24, 2021, the Navy issued “Trident Order #12 –Mandatory Vaccination for COVID-19.” The order specified that “Special Operations Designated Personnel (SEAL and SWCC) refusing to receive recommended vaccines based solely on personal or religious beliefs will still be medically disqualified,” court documents revealed.
This order meant that SEALs were designated as ""non-deployable"" if they submitted religious accommodation requests exempting them from the COVID vaccine. All special warfare forces were initially expected to come into compliance with the vaccine mandate by the middle of October 2021.
The order was put on hold due to a preliminary injunction that was affirmed by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in February 2022.
Fox News reports that a new filing in the lawsuit shows the Navy quietly reversed Trident Order #12 on May 22, 2022. A communication order was sent by the Navy on May 23 stating, ""This order rescinds reference A."" ""Ref A"" was referred to as ""Trident Order #12 on COVID-19 Vaccinations.""
Fox News Digital reached out to the Navy for clarification on whether the Navy replaced the order or why Trident Order #12 was being rescinded. ""The Navy does not comment on ongoing litigation,"" a Navy spokesperson responded.
Filings also show that the legal team representing the SEALs only became aware of the recession on September 1.
""To the best of counsel’s knowledge, Trident Order #12 was not replaced. As the Court will recall, Trident Order #12 stated that SEALs who are unvaccinated due to religious beliefs are medically disqualified, though SEALs who are unvaccinated due to medical reasons are not automatically disqualified. Trident Order #12 also implemented the COVID-19 vaccine mandate at the command level for Naval Special Warfare forces, setting a deadline of compliance for October 17, 2021,"" the SEALs' legal team wrote.

Pentagon’s ‘Blanket Denial’ of Religious Exemption Requests to Vaccine Prompts GOP Lawmakers to Demand Answers
More than a dozen Republican lawmakers have called on Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin to answer questions following the circulation earlier this month of a leaked memo by the Pentagon’s watchdog that found “potential noncompliance” with the law in the review and denial process of religious accommodation requests to the vaccine mandate.
The June 2 memo by Acting Inspector General (IG) Sean W. O’Donnell states that after reviewing dozens of denials of religious accommodation requests, the IG’s office “found a trend of generalized assessments rather than the individualized assessment that is required by Federal law and DoD and Military Service policies.”
In a Sept. 19 letter to Austin, 15 lawmakers pointed to the extremely low approval rates of religious exemption requests to the Department of Defence’s (DoD) vaccine mandate.
According to the most recent publicly-available data, only 196 religious accommodation requests have been approved out of more than 26,000 requests across the armed services.
Lawmakers wrote that it was “especially concerning” that most of the approved religious accommodation requests were granted to service members slated for retirement, and that “all branches have approved non-religious vaccine exemption requests at a far higher rate than religious exemptions.”
“This suggests the DoD is applying different policies towards servicemembers’ applications based on their religious beliefs and expected employment status,” the letter stated.
Referring to the memo, the lawmakers wrote that the “blanket denial” of religious accommodation requests violates DoD Instruction 1300.17 (pdf), which requires each religious accommodation request to be reviewed individually.
“In summary, according to the DoD IG’s memo, the Department has engaged in unlawful religious discrimination,” the lawmakers wrote.
The findings of the IG memo did not astonish Rep. Clay Higgins (R-La.), who signed the letter.
“The fact that the Department of Defense didn’t seriously consider religious exemptions is no surprise,” Higgins told The Epoch Times.
“We expected that the Biden administration had passed down some guidance to force compliance with the vaccine mandate, and that was reflected by the almost universal rate of denial.”
Another signatory Rep. Doug Lamborn (R-Co.) described the findings as “extremely concerning.”
“The fact that religious exemption cases were not reviewed individually and were only assessed for a maximum of 12 minutes on average is a clear violation of our service members’ Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) rights,” Lamborn told The Epoch Times in an email.
The Colorado congressman said that he will “continue to work tirelessly with my colleagues in Congress to ensure DoD upholds the First Amendment rights of our men and women in the military above an unlawful vaccine mandate.”
The Congress members, in the letter, requested various records to be provided no later than Sept. 30. These include a complete copy of the IG’s memo dated June 2, all records associated with Navy, Air Force, and Army religious accommodation requests for COVID-19 vaccinations, as well as any of the DoD internal policy directives associated with the review of religious accommodation requests for the vaccines.
“The COVID vaccine mandate has been detrimental to recruitment efforts and military readiness. It has also been proven completely unnecessary,” Higgins said. “All federal COVID mandates should be terminated, especially the absurd vaccine mandate on our Armed Forces,” he added.
Army Chief Warrant Officer Danny Erickson (a pseudonym), who initially published parts of the leaked memo on his website, said that the document proves the Pentagon’s leadership is aware of the issue.
“It can no longer be said that the [secretary of defense] didn’t know, [because] he’s been aware since at least June 2,” Erickson told The Epoch Times.
For Erickson, “the most concerning thing about the IG letter to … Austin, and the subsequent silence from the DOD in response to it going public, is the blatant disregard for law.”
“Congress has confronted [Austin], and now we’ll wait to see if he’ll respond or if he’ll ignore the letter as he’s done with so many others sent in the past from members of Congress,” he added.
Erikson emphasized that his views don’t reflect those of the Department of Defense or the Department of the Army. The DoD did not respond to requests for comment.",en,Pentagon’s ‘Blanket Denial’ of Religious Exemption Requests to Vaccine Prompts GOP Lawmakers to Demand Answers,RIGHT,MIXED,LOW CREDIBILITY,,TRUE
4459,theblaze.com,https://www.theblaze.com/news/military-watchdog-vaccine-religious-liberty,"The military may have acted too speedily to deny religious exemptions for COVID-19 vaccination requested by service members, a Defense Department watchdog concluded in a report.
Pentagon Inspector General Sean O'Donnell wrote there was a ""concerning"" trend in the number of exemptions and the rate at which they were rejected, according to a June 2 memo reported by Military.com.
""We found a trend of generalized assessments rather than the individualized assessment that is required by Federal law and DoD and Military Service policies,"" O'Donnell wrote to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. ""Some of the appellate decisions included documentation that demonstrated a greater consideration of facts and circumstances involved in a request.""
Austin ordered a vaccine mandate for troops on August 24, 2021, the day after the Food and Drug Administration granted full approval to the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. Service members were required to either get the shots or be ultimately discharged.
The Army, the largest branch of the military, has received 8,514 religious exemption requests of which 1,602 were rejected. Only 24 have been approved and the rest are pending as of Aug. 12.
The inspector general estimated there were about 50 denials per day in a 90-day period across all branches of the military. O'Donnell indicated military officials spent just minutes reviewing each exemption instead of thoroughly reviewing each case, making the military vulnerable to lawsuits from service members who were forced to resign after refusing to take a COVID-19 vaccine.
""The volume and rate at which decisions were made to deny requests is concerning,"" the memo reportedly said. ""Assuming a 10-hour work day with no breaks or attention to other matters, the average review period was about 12 minutes for each package. Such a review period seems insufficient to process each request in an individualized manner and still perform the duties required of their position.""
Several legal challenges have already been filed alleging unvaccinated service members were discriminated against by the military. In late March, a Texas judge blocked the Navy from discharging sailors with pending exemption requests, Military.com reported. Last week, the U.S. Marine Corps announced a pause on administrative actions against unvaccinated Marines after a federal judge in Florida in August blocked the Corps from discharging religious exemption applicants.
Many service members remain in limbo as the Biden administration navigates these legal challenges. The Army National Guard has about 40,000 unvaccinated soldiers that it has no plan for, according to Military.com.

Unvaccinated Navy soldiers who are still seeking religious exemptions from the COVID-19 vaccine are 'stuck in limbo' and being forced to live in deplorable conditions on the USS Eisenhower as the military refuse to let them leave the service.
The lawsuit was first filed by nonprofit First Liberty Institute in November on behalf of 35 active-duty Navy SEALs, but has since become a class-action lawsuit representing all Navy members seek religious exemptions.

There are currently 4,244 exemptions pending, according to First Liberty, and the Navy has only granted 22 permeant medical exemptions and 189 temporary ones. Almost 1,500 sailors have separated from the Navy due to the vaccine requirement, as of late July.

'To date, the US Navy has not approved a single religious accommodation request. And it seems the Navy isn’t giving religious service members the proper legal consideration required by law,' First Liberty Institute wrote on its website.
'Our clients are boldly leading the fight against the vaccine mandate, but no service member should face discipline or punishment for following their faith.'
However, the Navy's website does say it has approved 44 religious exemptions as of late July between active-duty and reserves.
An unknown number service members are reportedly been subject to living in deplorable condition on the Eisenhower, including be subjected to backed-up toilets and showers, dirty living conditions, and sewage flooding on the Eisenhower, which is stationed in Virginia, according to the lawsuit.
'Many sailors are stuck living on the Ike and other vessels because they have no other options and they are not permitted to leave the area without permission from their commanders because of their vaccination status,' Mike Berry, of First Liberty Institute and a Marine facing his own religious exemption debacle, told DailyMail.com on Wednesday.

DailyMail.com has contacted the Navy for comment.
Berry blamed the Biden Administration and the Pentagon for wanting to 'purge anyone from the military who has a religious objection to the vaccine' as the reasoning this is an ongoing problem since November.

'They approved thousands of medical and administrative exemptions, but not a single religious exemption,' he told DailyMail.com. 'That shows that the Pentagon isn’t concerned with whether someone is vaccinated or not, but they only care about the reason the person isn’t vaccinated.'
One soldier, who was not named, said they were told they 'could not leave the area' after requesting to be terminated from the military due to the vaccinate requirement. He was moved to the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower aircraft berthing barge, according to Fox News.
'Because I could not leave the area, I moved onto the berthing barge for the Eisenhower. The conditions on the barge are deplorable, much like the USS George Washington, which is anchored in the same shipyard,' they said in the June filing, viewed by Fox News.
'There is mold everywhere and the barge’s toilets back up and leak. The water leaks out of the base of the toilet and collects near my rack and out into the hall. On bad days, it goes into the berthings on the other side. The leaks seem to be sewage—it smells like sewage and looks like it too.'
The sailor also said there was 'some sort of worm' living in the toilet bowl water and on the floors where the water leaked from.
'I have contacted mental health services multiple times,' they said. 'I do want—desperately—to be separated from the Navy as soon as possible, but I struggle with withdrawing my request as I feel it could signal that my religious objection was somehow not genuine, and it is.'

Another soldier claimed in the lawsuit that he was not allowed to separate from the military, despite his wife's due date for their second child being August 2022.
'In anticipation of my separation, my wife and I sold our house, and my wife and one-year-old son have moved to another state,' the soldier said. 'I have been unable to join her and my son, or to start my new job, because the Navy has told me that I am not allowed to separate from the Navy due to this lawsuit.'
A Navy technician, who has served nine years, wrote that they suffered a lower performance rating, which they claim is due to the pending exemption.
The technician regularly scored a 'must promote' rating throughout their prior evaluations, but in the latest one, they only scored 'promote.'
'This downgrade in ranking makes it appear as if my skills as a sailor have regressed. I have maintained my work throughout the year and was told during a briefing on my evaluation that the rating was not due to my performance, but my upcoming separation because of the denial of my religious accommodation,' they wrote in sworn testimony.
In addition, they claimed the work environment was 'extremely toxic over the vaccine issue' and has caused them 'stress.'
'Because of the hardship and stress this process has brought to my family, I do not wish to be a part of the United States Navy anymore,' they wrote.
In January, the Navy discharged 45 service members, including 23 that were active-duty.

Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA)
Service members who have been denied their religious exemption requests and subsequently discharged have been fighting back under the RFRA of 1993. The RFRA was meant to protect individuals’ religious freedoms against government laws that run counter to their beliefs.
Air Force members have filed a class-wide temporary restraining order meant to halt their discharge from the military while they file their religious exemptions. So far, the Air Force has granted 68 religious exemptions. Compare that to the 6,113 denied and the over 2,000 that are still pending.
I hope they win! This is religious discrimination and it should NOT be tolerated in America…period!https://t.co/HJp1APOraZ — John Henley (@JohnHenleyVA) June 1, 2022
According to the lawsuit:
“Plaintiffs have lost promotions that had already been announced, received official discipline, been barred from training opportunities, and placed in a no-pay status…”
So while members who are discharged for refusing to get the vaccine are discharged honorably, it doesn’t negate the fact that many are subject to punishments before their discharge.
Support and Defend the Constitution
Director of military affairs for First Liberty Institute Mike Berry said of the members fighting to stay in uniform:
“…military leaders are forcing tens of thousands of our bravest out of the service because they’ve chosen to live according to their faith. Religious liberty is essential to national security, and our service members deserve better.”
It’s not just Air Force members who are fighting back. A group of Navy SEALS are also fighting in the courts to keep their careers.
In March, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas ruled to expand a preliminary injunction to stop the DOD from taking action against sailors. Judge Reed O’Connor said of his decision:
“Here, the potential class members have suffered the ‘same injury’ arising from violations of their constitutional rights. Each has submitted a religious accommodation request, and each has had his request denied, delayed, or dismissed on appeal.”
Here comes the kicker:
“…it is hard to imagine a more consistent display of discrimination as previously explained in this Court’s preliminary injunction order, Plaintiffs have suffered the serious injury of infringement of their religious liberty rights under RFRA and the First Amendment.”
So you might’ve raised your right hand to swear an oath to protect and defend the Constitution. Still, it doesn’t apply to you if you have a religious objection to government law.
After all, the “Constitution isn’t absolute,” as some of our politicians try to convince us.
In total, all four military branches have discharged nearly 4,000 active duty service members over the COVID vaccine mandate.
RELATED: Are Lawsuits The Only Way To Stop The Fake News? Adam Carolla Says Yes
But It’s About Readiness, Right?
The decision to mandate the COVID vaccine for service members was born out of a need to maintain a ready force. When the military uses this term, they are focused on the ability to deploy.
Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin wrote in a memo:
“To defend this nation, we need a healthy a ready force.”
No doubt, I couldn’t agree more. After 20 years of service, I was stuck with more vaccines than I could count. Flu shots, TB, Yellow Fever, Anthrax, Small Pox, and COVID, among others, I’m sure I have forgotten.
A group of @USAirForce members who are refusing to get a #Vaccine against #COVID19 are asking a federal court to block the military from punishing them, asserting the order is unconstitutional. Their requests for religious exemption were all denied. https://t.co/pnZA4NMEPt — The Epoch Times (@EpochTimes) June 2, 2022
My opinion has been and always will be that the military’s job is to take the fight to the bad guys. That means deploying at a moment’s notice and being as lethal as possible.
However, with 97% of the military vaccinated against COVID, it seems strange to argue that the small percentage with religious exemptions would degrade the military’s readiness.
Religious Exemption = Lack of Confidence?
Perhaps the most alarming case surrounds the anchoring of an East Coast guided-missile destroyer. The Commanding Officer filed a religious exemption to the COVID vaccine.
When the Navy tried to remove the Commanding Officer, a Federal judge in Florida prevented the action under the RFRA rules. So the Navy has opted to classify the destroyer as “out of commission” due to a “lack of confidence” in the CO’s ability to lead.
Vice Admiral Daniel Dwyer, Commander of the United States Second Fleet, said of the court’s decision:
“The court’s order effectively requires the Navy to leave a subordinate commander in command of a warship, despite his senior officer’s questions relating to his fitness to discharge his duties as ordered.”
So the message is if you stand by your faith that guides you and is very much a part of your fiber as a human being, you may be an unfit leader? Standing up for your religious rights makes you unfit to lead?

Back to the young Air Force Academy cadets. While they will graduate with their undergraduate degrees, they may have to pay back the steep tuition.
Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall will determine if the cadets need to “reimburse the United States for education costs in lieu of service.” Part of the deal to attend a military academy is to get your college education for free, provided you serve a set amount of time in uniform.

Since they will not be commissioned, they will not serve. But I mean, the Biden administration will forgive student loans anyway, so what’s the big deal, right?
An Obama administration study found that the average transgender soldier would spend 238 days recovering from sex-change surgery, making them nondeployable during that time frame. The Palm Institute estimated in 2018 that 14,700 transgender troops were serving active duty and reserves.
That’s roughly 3,498,600 days nondeployable if they receive sex-change surgery. That’s 9,585 years.
But it’s about readiness, right?

4713,thecentersquare.com,https://www.thecentersquare.com/national/liberty-counsel-military-continues-to-deny-religious-exemptions-as-navy-seals-head-to-court/article_638e3c8a-89b1-11ec-a3e0-070cf44b8fed.html,"(The Center Square) – The U.S. military continues to deny religious exemptions to service members, Liberty Counsel argues, after reports were filed by each department of the military ahead of a U.S. District court hearing scheduled for Thursday.

Liberty Counsel sued on behalf of military plaintiffs’ whose COVID-19 religious exemptions were denied, and as a result faced discharge, court martial, or termination.

Judge Steven Merryday last week granted a temporary restraining order for two plaintiffs, a U.S. Marine Corps lieutenant colonel and a U.S. Navy captain and Command Surface Warfare officer, as a result of Liberty Counsel’s request for an emergency injunction. Both were facing imminent removal from their positions of command, and ultimate discharge from the military.

As part of the ongoing litigation process, Merryday ordered each branch of the military to file a detailed report every two weeks on the number of COVID-19 religious exemptions filed and granted. The latest filings received by the court as of Feb. 4 reveal that out of 24,818 religious exemption requests the four branches received, four were granted. At least two of the four were granted to service members who were already leaving the military, Liberty Counsel says.

While religious exemptions continued to be denied, 4,146 medical exemptions were granted.

Liberty Counsel is asking the judge to extend the emergency injunction and grant injunctions for all plaintiffs at a hearing scheduled for Thursday. Other military class members have also received final denials to their appeals from their initial requests, and their “irreversible vaccinate-or-separate choices are imminent,” Liberty Counsel said.

The Orlando-based religious freedom organization maintains the Biden administration and the Department of Defense “have no legal right to deny the religious exemptions and accommodations from the COVID shots for the military. Our service members need immediate relief from these mandates.”

In his 10-page order granting the emergency injunction, Merryday said he was searching in vain for any justification for the military branches’ refusal to grant accommodations.

“The record in this action establishes that the two service members are very likely to prevail on their claim that their respective branch of the military has wrongfully denied a religious exemption from COVID-19 vaccination,” he wrote. “The record creates a strong inference that the services are discriminatorily and systematically denying religious exemptions without a meaningful and fair hearing and without the showing required under RFRA (while simultaneously granting medical exemptions and permitting unvaccinated persons to continue in service without adverse consequence).

“One struggles to imagine a wholesome and lawful explanation for the results evidenced in this record,” he added. “The military is well aware of the frailty of their arguments in defense of their practices. Those arguments both procedural and substantive, are rejected in an action that is distinctively parallel to this action. … Rejection on the same or a more encompassing basis is likely in this action (especially if the conduct of the military continues along the present lines).”

He notes that the two service members requesting an immediate injunction faced “either (1) a most-likely-unlawful deprivation of their accumulated status and standing in the United States military, as well as prospective advancement and benefits, or (2) deprivation of their constitutional and statutory rights to Free Exercise and the statutory right to receive a religious exemption unless the military can meet the statutory burden of proof, which the military has not and likely cannot. On the other hand, the military faces a trivial, if any, prospect of material injury …”

Merryday’s ruling was “a great victory for religious freedom,” Liberty Counsel Founder and Chairman Mat Staver said. “It is shameful how the military is treating these honorable service members. The military under the Biden administration is denying every religious exemption request while granting medical exemptions. The abuse and pressure being placed upon these military members is unconscionable and must stop.”

The lawsuit was filed after Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin issued a memo directing ""the Secretaries of the Military Departments to immediately begin full vaccination of all members of the Armed Forces under DoD authority on active duty or in the Ready Reserve, including the National Guard, who are not fully vaccinated against COVID-19.""

The directive states, ""Mandatory vaccination against COVID-19 will only use COVID-19 vaccines that receive full licensure from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), in accordance with FDA-approved labeling and guidance.""

Despite claims made by the FDA, Liberty Counsel maintains there is currently no FDA-approved COVID-19 shot available anywhere in the U.S. All shots being administered are only through emergency use authorization, which according to federal law requires informed consent and that EUA drugs be optional, not mandatory.",en,Liberty Counsel: Military continues to deny religious exemptions as Navy SEALs head to court,RIGHT-CENTER,MOSTLY FACTUAL,,,

The amount has been updated to 0.07%.
The Air Force said Tuesday it has allowed nine airmen to opt out of the Pentagon’s coronavirus vaccine mandate for religious reasons.
The exemptions mark a first for the service’s roughly 500,000 troops. The Air Force acknowledged the change after a military document submitted as part of a court case seemingly contradicted the service’s position that no one had earned a pass because of their faith.
“The Department of the Air Force has approved eight religious accommodations and one religious accommodation appeal,” service spokeswoman Ann Stefanek said in an email. “The Department of the Air Force determined the service members’ accommodations could be supported with no impact to mission readiness.”
As of Tuesday, the Air Force has rejected nearly 3,700 religious exemption requests and appeals with almost 3,300 more still under consideration — though the total number has fluctuated in weekly data updates. Stefanek declined to release further information on the approvals. Those nine people comprise 0.07% of the 12,623 religious waiver applicants in the system as of Feb. 3.

Thousands of service members across the Defense Department have cited their faith as a reason to get out of receiving COVID-19 shots, though they have been largely unsuccessful. The military offers exemptions to people whose religions oppose using modern medicine, like Christian Scientists, but the waivers have become a sought-after tool for anyone looking to avoid the politically polarized vaccines.
For instance, some Catholics argue they can’t take some vaccines that are loosely tied to cell lines derived from abortion. However, the shots do not contain fetal cells, and the Catholic Church endorses vaccination against COVID-19. Others, like evangelical Protestants, eschew the shots on the grounds that their health is in God’s hands.
Three Marines snagged religious exemptions as of Jan. 27; the Army and Navy have issued none.
Until Tuesday, the Air Force had said no one had shown a sincere belief that their faith should keep them from inoculation, or that public health concerns outweighed their objection. But a court document filed Feb. 4, in a class-action lawsuit brought by troops protesting the mandate, indicated otherwise.
As of Feb. 3, the Air Force had approved five initial requests for a religious waiver and granted one exemption upon appeal, according to data submitted to federal district court in Florida by Col. Jason Holbrook, who runs the COVID-19 team under Air Force deputy staff director Nancy Dolan.

The popular “Air Force amn/nco/snco” Facebook page published Holbrook’s information on Sunday. The service did not respond to questions emailed on Tuesday about the data.
As of Jan. 31, 96% of the active duty Air Force and Space Force, the Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve were fully vaccinated against the coronavirus. About 501,000 airmen and guardians serve in the Air Force and Space Force, not including civilian employees or contractors.
The Department of the Air Force tries to process requests within 30 business days. Active duty airmen and guardians were required to be fully vaccinated as of Nov. 2, 2021, followed by Reservists on Dec. 2 and Guardsmen on Dec. 31, 2021 — the only date that still falls within the 30-day window for consideration.
As of Jan. 31, the service had granted about 1,500 medical exemptions for conditions such as severe allergic reactions, not including those that have expired, and around 1,800 administrative exemptions for people who are leaving military service. It’s unclear why the number of administrative waivers dropped from about 2,300 over the past week.
“Religious accommodations are a subset of administrative exemptions and are determined by the [major command and field command] commanders,” according to the Air Force. “Appeals are determined by the [Air Force] Surgeon General with inputs from the chaplain and staff judge advocate. Individuals do not have to get immunized as long as their request is in the process of being decided.”
The Air Force had kicked out 142 active duty airmen as of Monday, Stefanek said, up from 125 on Jan. 27.
RELATED
Holbrook’s data show that no one who failed to obtain a religious waiver despite appealing their case has been separated from the service. As of Jan. 31, however, the Air Force had blocked exemptions for more than 400 personnel.
Active duty airmen and Title 32 Guardsmen who want to get out must leave by April 1, or no later than the beginning of the fifth month after their last appeal is rejected.
“Service members who continue to refuse to obey a lawful order to receive the COVID-19 vaccine after their exemption request/final appeal has been denied, or retirement/separation has not been approved, will be subject to administrative discharge,” the Air Force said.
Military leaders are encouraging their forces to get the jab and lessen the likelihood that long-term effects of coronavirus infection and a higher death toll will deal a blow to combat readiness.
Americans have reported more than 76.4 million cases of COVID-19 since the pandemic began in December 2019, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About 900,000 people in the United States have died, including 156 Air Force and Space Force service members, civilian employees, contractors and their dependents.

More than 213 million Americans have gotten both of a two-dose Moderna or Pfizer vaccine regimen or the single-shot Johnson & Johnson version. About 42%, or 90.2 million, of them are further protected with a recommended booster dose.
Approximately 20% of Americans ages 5 and older remain unvaccinated (the shots are not yet authorized for the youngest children), and at drastically higher risk of severe illness and death without that protection.
“All COVID-19 vaccines currently available in the United States are effective at preventing COVID-19,” the CDC said. “COVID-19 vaccination helps protect you by creating an antibody response without you having to experience sickness. Getting vaccinated yourself may also protect people around you.”
Unvaccinated people who have already contracted the virus are more than twice as likely to catch COVID-19 again than their previously infected, vaccinated counterparts, the agency added.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Air Force became the second military service to approve religious exemptions to the mandatory COVID-19 vaccine, granting requests from nine airmen to avoid the shots, officials said Tuesday.
The nine approved so far represent just a tiny fraction of the more than 6,400 requested by Air Force troops, and they come as other service members are challenging the lack of religious exemptions in court cases. The Marine Corps is the only other military service to grant any religious accommodations, allowing three so far. The Army and Navy have not approved any.
The services have come under criticism for their failure to grant religious exemptions, with members of Congress, the military and the public questioning if the review processes have been fair. All together, the services have received more than 14,000 requests for religious exemptions.
Military leaders have argued that religious exemptions to any of the many vaccines troops are required to get have been very rare over the years. Service members are required to get as many as 17 different vaccines, depending on where they deploy.
A federal judge in Texas granted a preliminary injunction last month, stopping the Navy from acting against 35 sailors for refusing on religious grounds to comply with an order to get the COVID vaccine.
Eight of the Air Force approvals came during the initial review process, and one was granted on appeal to senior Air Force leaders. So far, religious exemption requests from more than 3,200 airmen were denied, and another 3,200 are pending.
“The Department of the Air Force determined the service members’ accommodations could be supported with no impact to mission readiness,” the statement Tuesday said.
Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and military leaders have argued that the vaccine is critical to maintaining military readiness and the health of the force. And all of the services have now either discharged personnel for refusing the vaccine, or put a system in place to do so.
The Marine Corps has discharged 469, the Air Force has discharged 179 and the Navy has discharged 118, according to data released in the last week. The number include active-duty personnel and entry-level recruits who were still in boot camp. The Army has issued more than 3,000 formal letters of reprimand, and fired six soldiers, but has not discharged anyone yet.
All the military services have said the exemption decisions are based not only on the individual request, but also on its impact on the unit, its mission and readiness, and the health and safety of other troops.
Those who get an exemption and are allowed to stay in the service may, however, see an impact on their jobs.
The Navy and the Marine Corps have said unvaccinated service members are not allowed to deploy out to sea on ships, where infections can more easily spread. Those who have approved exemptions — either medical, administrative or religious — are assigned to shore duties.
At least 97% of the troops in each service have gotten at least one shot.",en,Air Force approves 9 religious exemptions for COVID vaccine,LEFT-CENTER,,,,TRUE
4756,reason.com,https://reason.com/volokh/2022/03/22/no-pseudonymity-in-challenge-to-denial-of-religious-exemption-from-military-vaccine-mandate/,"From U.S. Army ROTC ECP Cadet Doe v. Biden, decided yesterday by Chief Judge Beryl Howell (D.D.C.) (contrary to decisions in M.D. Fla., N.D. Ill. and D. Colo., but consistently with this nonprecedential Seventh Circuit order):
[1.] Plaintiff argues that pseudonymity is justified because his ""sincere religious beliefs"" and ""medical decisions and past infections"" are ""personal intimate information justifying anonymity."" Plaintiff asserts, in conclusory fashion, that ""[d]ecisions regarding vaccinations, illness and treatment … are just like decisions regarding birth control,"" which other circuits have cited as grounds to allow a plaintiff to proceed under pseudonym.
At this early stage of the litigation, plaintiff has not persuasively met the burden of showing that the legitimate privacy interests he holds outweigh the public's presumptive interest in knowing the details of this litigation. Plaintiff has articulated no privacy interest sufficient to rebut the presumption in favor of open proceedings….
Despite the presumption in favor of disclosure [of party names], … [c]ourts …, in special [and rare] circumstances, may permit a party to proceed anonymously. A party seeking to do so, however, ""bears the weighty burden of both demonstrating a concrete need for such secrecy, and identifying the consequences that would likely befall it if forced to proceed in its own name."" Once that showing has been made, ""the court must then 'balance the litigant's legitimate interest in anonymity against countervailing interests in full disclosure.'"" …
Plaintiff, ""a nineteen-year-old male ROTC Early Commissioning Program (ECP) candidate"" who is ""currently a drilling member of the Army National Guard,"" has moved to proceed under pseudonym in the instant action challenging defendants' vaccination policies and their interference with his ""fundamental right to the free exercise of religion."" For the reasons set forth below, plaintiff's motion is denied, subject to any further consideration by the United States District Judge to whom this case is randomly assigned….
This is not an obvious conclusion to reach, since birth control methods and choices engage far more personal physical and medical details than, as here, a shot in the arm with a vaccination or identifying as a Christian, which millions of people do in this country and around the world. Without more, what plaintiff deems ""personal intimate information"" is insufficient grounds ""to grant the rare dispensation of anonymity,"" and indeed plaintiff cites no cases from the D.C. Circuit in support of his position. Even if some information regarding the details of plaintiff's medical history and treatment, beyond having had COVID, were sensitive and highly personal, this would at most warrant limited sealing of that information. The first James factor weighs against permitting plaintiff to proceed pseudonymously….
[2.] [T]he asserted risk of retaliatory harm [to plaintiff] is both speculative and minimal. Plaintiff asserts that ""[i]n the present climate, he is likely to be labeled as an 'anti-vaxer'—which he is not,"" and ""his reputation tarnished both inside and outside of the military,"" which could make him ""likely to be targeted for retaliation in the course of his career."" The risk of retaliation that plaintiff describes is entirely speculative, however, and the risk of harassment and criticism represents the quintessential ""annoyance and criticism that may attend any litigation,"" and is far less severe than the degree of serious mental harm or physical danger necessary to override the strong public interest in transparent legal proceedings. See Qualls v. Rumsfeld (D.D.C. 2005) (""bringing litigation can subject a plaintiff to scrutiny and criticism and can affect the way plaintiff is viewed by coworkers and friends, but fears of embarrassment or vague, unsubstantiated fears of retaliatory actions by higher-ups do not permit a plaintiff to proceed under a pseudonym""); see also Doe v. Court of Common Pleas (W.D. Pa. Nov. 3, 2017) (denying request to proceed under pseudonym based on plaintiff's argument ""that anonymity is necessary to protect her from unwanted media attention and a potentially negative public response to the allegations in the Complaint"" as ""not sufficient to outweigh the public's right to access court proceedings.""). The second James factor thus weighs against granting plaintiff's motion….
[3.] [T]he fact that this suit is against the government, also weighs against granting plaintiff's motion, as the law is well-settled that ""there is a heightened public interest when an individual or entity files a suit against the government."" Here, plaintiff seeks an injunction ""prohibiting the Defendants … from enforcing the vaccination policies challenged in this Complaint,"" and the public interest in knowing the detail of the litigation that could affect government policy broadly is particularly great.
[4.] [A]llowing plaintiff to proceed under pseudonym will not prejudice defendants in any way. Plaintiff's identity is presumably known to defendants through his ROTC enrollment, or could be disclosed to them through counsel. There is no reason to think that allowing plaintiff to proceed under pseudonym would compromise defendants' ability to defend this action or pose any ""risk of unfairness to the opposing party."" [Nonetheless, t]aking these factors together, plaintiff has presented no compelling justification for ""the rare dispensation of pseudonymous status,"" and thus has failed to demonstrate a need for secrecy or identify consequences likely to befall plaintiff if he proceeds in his own name….",en,No Pseudonymity in Challenge to Denial of Religious Exemption from Military Vaccine Mandate,RIGHT-CENTER,HIGH,HIGH CREDIBILITY,,
