The secretary of the Air Force will decide whether the three will have to reimburse the federal government for their education costs, given that they won't be serving, the AP reports. A fourth cadet who had refused the shots decided about a week ago to be vaccinated, a spokesman for the academy said, and will graduate as scheduled and become an officer. Our original story from May 14 follows:
Four cadets at the Air Force Academy may not graduate or be commissioned as military officers this month because they have refused the COVID-19 vaccine, and they may be required to pay back thousands of dollars in tuition costs, Air Force officials said. It's the only military academy, so far, where cadets may face such penalties, the AP reports. The Army and Navy said that as of now, none of their seniors is being prevented from graduating at the Military Academy at West Point or the Naval Academy in Annapolis due to vaccine refusals. The graduations are in about two weeks.
Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin last year made the COVID-19 vaccinations mandatory for service members, including those at the military academies, saying the vaccine is critical to maintaining military readiness and the health of the force. Military leaders have argued that troops for decades have been required to get as many as 17 vaccines to maintain the health of the force, particularly those deploying overseas. Students arriving at the military academies get a regimen of shots on their first day—including those for measles, mumps, and Rubella—if they aren't already vaccinated. And they routinely receive regular flu shots in the fall.

Cadets at the U.S. Air Force Academy who refused to get vaccinated will receive their degrees but cannot attend the ceremony or receive commissions.
The three cadets who refused to get the COVID-19 vaccine were told earlier this month they had the option of getting the shot or not receiving a degree or commission after graduation. There was a fourth cadet who decided to get vaccinated before Wednesday’s graduation. The other three cadets will receive degrees from the academy, but they will not receive a commission.

Besides not receiving a commission, the secretary of the Air Force will determine whether the three cadets will have to reimburse the United States for the cost of their education because they won’t be serving.
The Air Force Academy is the only military school refusing to commission graduates who aren’t vaccinated, according to the Associated Press.
Vaccine requirements have bedeviled the Air Force since Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin instituted them last year.
The Supreme Court has largely stayed out of disputes between service members and military branches.
Last month, the court said it wouldn’t get involved in a vaccine mandate challenge brought by an Air Force Reserve lieutenant colonel who said he refused the vaccine on religious grounds. The court didn’t say why it wouldn’t take up Lt. Col. Jonathan Dunn’s case.

In November of last year, the Air Force kicked out 20 recruits who refused to get vaccinated. A month later, the branch discharged 27 active-duty members, making them the first service members to lose their jobs for refusing to comply with the mandate.
Roughly 4,000 active-duty members have been discharged over vaccine disputes, including 2,100 Marines, 900 Navy sailors, 500 Army soldiers, and 360 airmen.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Three cadets at the U.S. Air Force Academy who have refused the COVID-19 vaccine will not be commissioned as military officers but will graduate with bachelor’s degrees, the academy said Saturday.
Academy spokesman Dean Miller said that a fourth cadet who had refused the vaccine until about a week ago, decided to be vaccinated and will graduate and become an Air Force officer.

All of the more than 1,000 Army cadets at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York, graduated and were commissioned as officers earlier in the day and all were vaccinated.
The Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, said Saturday that none of the Navy or Marine Corps seniors there are being prevented from commissioning due to vaccine refusals. That graduation is later this week, and the Air Force ceremony is Wednesday in Colorado. Ahead of that ceremony, the U.S. Air Force Academy Board conducted its standard review of whether this year’s class had met all graduation requirements on Friday.

americanmilitarynews.com,https://americanmilitarynews.com/2022/05/air-force-academy-cadet-submits-resignation-after-refusing-vaccine-on-religious-grounds/,"A senior Air Force Academy cadet who faces the possibility of being kept from graduating with his classmates after refusing to take the COVID-19 vaccine on religious grounds has begun proceedings to resign from the school, according to an academy official.
The cadet, whose name was not released, has submitted paperwork but his resignation has not been finalized and is not yet official, said academy spokesman Lt. Col. Brian Maguire.
If the resignation goes through, it will leave two senior cadets, or “firsties,” who have refused the vaccine and will not be allowed to participate in next Wednesday’s commencement ceremony, according to Gordon Klingenschmitt, a former Navy chaplain who has been advocating for the religious rights of 13 cadets who raised faith-based objections to taking the vaccine.
Dean Miller, academy chief of media relations, told The Gazette on Saturday that the three senior cadets still could graduate and receive their commissions if they commit to receiving the COVID vaccine according to the FDA’s schedule.
One senior cadet has reversed course and taken the vaccine, Klingenschmitt said, but only because he is being treated for cancer and refusal would have made him ineligible for military health care benefits.
“He basically was pressured to violate his conscience and religious freedom,” said Klingenschmitt, a 1991 academy graduate. “He gave in and took the vaccine only in order to save his life.”
Klingenschmitt said he did not know a cadet had begun the resignation process, but said he would have advised against it.
“Strategically, it’s a bad idea to resign because they might lose their legal standing, and they may be forced to repay their tuition,” he said. “If they resign, they still owe.”
Several of the cadets who refused the vaccine are hoping to add their names to the more than 200 “intervening plaintiffs” in a lawsuit filed in Ohio earlier this year, Klingenschmitt said. The lawsuit, Doster v. Kendall, claims that Air Force commanders were under orders to deny religious waivers to any airmen who wished to remain in the service.
A copy of the lawsuit, obtained by The Gazette, details a whistleblower account alleging that in October 2021 Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall held a closed-door meeting with commanders “responsible for adjudicating accommodation requests to the Air Force’s vaccine mandate” and told them “no religious accommodations could or should be approved for anyone who would be remaining in the Department of the Air Force.”
The lawsuit is requesting a preliminary injunction that would temporarily keep the Department of the Air Force from taking any administrative or punitive action against the plaintiffs.
According to the lawsuit, the Air Force has granted, to date, nearly 2,300 medical and administrative vaccination exemptions, but only 42 out of more than 5,000 initial requests for religious exemption. All 42 service members who received the religious waivers were nearing the end of their careers.
“To be clear, the Department of the Air Force has accommodated thousands of airmen, at least from a medical or administrative perspective, thus belying any claim that vaccination is a must for mission accomplishment,” the lawsuit states.
On Wednesday, academy Director of Public Affairs Brian Maguire told The Gazette that “we provided resources and information to the cadets in order to make a decision and graduate with the Class of 2022.
“The majority of our religious accommodation requests centered on the use of stem cells in the development and/or production of the currently available vaccines. There are vaccines available that did not use stem cells in the development, testing or production, which was presented as an option. The cadets refused to commit to this vaccine.”
Klingenschmitt said several Air Force Academy cadets have received an official letter of reprimand for not taking the vaccine. A redacted copy of the letter states the cadets are in violation of Article 90 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice for disobeying an order from a superior officer. A prospective military officer is expected to follow orders from the officers appointed over them even if they disagree with the orders, the letter states.
“Your failure to follow this order calls into question your suitability for military service,” the letter reads, in part. “In addition, your failure to follow the vaccination order jeopardizes the health, safety and readiness of yourself and of your fellow military members and compromises our mission.”
Klingenschmitt said he believes the academy has violated the spirit, if not the letter, of the vaccine policy by denying religious exemptions across the board.
“The vaccine policy says exemptions will be granted on a case-by-case basis,” he said. “Well, if they’ve granted zero out of 13, then it’s no longer a case-by-case basis. It is a blanket denial.”
About 80 people attended a rally on Saturday in support of the senior vaccine refusers, Klingenschmitt said. Another protest will take place near the north and south Academy gates on graduation day, May 25, he said.
“Our protest signs will be directed at (academy Superintendent) Gen. Richard Clark,” he said. “They say, ‘Keep your oath. Defend religious freedom. Let them graduate.'”

americanmilitarynews.com,https://americanmilitarynews.com/2022/05/protest-planned-as-air-force-academy-cadets-who-refused-vaccine-and-were-denied-waiver-face-expulsion/,"After their requests for religion-based exemptions to a federal COVID-19 vaccine mandate for service members were denied by the U.S. Air Force Academy, more than a dozen of the school’s cadets remain in limbo and face “administrative separation,” an action that effectively “fires” them from the military, adds a letter of reprimand to their files, and — for some — could mean they’re on the hook to repay almost $200,000 in government scholarship money.
Four of those cadets — “firsties,” or seniors — won’t be joining their classmates for the May 25 graduation ceremony at the academy’s campus north of Colorado Springs, the lawyer representing three of them said Friday. Whether they receive their AFA degrees at all is a question that most likely will be decided in the courts, long after the caps have settled.
“I believe that if somebody changed their mind (about receiving the vaccine), they could wind up being commissioned, graduating late, and not being separated from the Air Force … however they’ve got a limited amount of time to make that decision, and we’re running out of time,” said Mike Rose, the South Carolina attorney and 1969 AFA graduate representing three of the senior cadets.
The Air Force Academy requires all cadets to have received a full course of the two-dose vaccine by Aug. 2. There’s a required eight-week gap between each shot. That, Rose said, means they’re technically already “out of time.”
For those who haven’t yet received their initial poke, the options now are limited, said the academy, which urged cadets to “obey the lawful order and receive the vaccine.”
“Another option is they can elect to voluntarily resign. Otherwise, they will face consequences for disobeying a lawful order,” said Director of Public Affairs Lt. Col. Brian Maguire, responding to questions from The Gazette.
“If cadets choose to remain unvaccinated, they could be dismissed from the Academy,” he said. Consequences, including scholarship reimbursement, are a “decision (that) will be made after a disenrollment decision has been made.”
Of the 13 AFA cadets who sought waivers and have not received the COVID-19 vaccination, he said four are seniors, two are juniors, one is a sophomore and six are freshmen. All applied for a religious exemption, which was denied. Their appeals also were denied.
“As each religious exemption is handled on a case-by-case basis, I can’t speculate as to what would result in an approval for a religious exemption,” Maguire said. “We continue to ensure the religious accommodation waiver process adheres to Department of Defense and Department of the Air Force guidance and respects the religious rights of each cadet.”
In August of last year, the Pentagon made vaccines mandatory for all service members, including cadets and those in ROTC programs. It also said waivers would be granted for those with a good reason, medical or faith. So far, few religion-based exemptions have been approved, throughout all branches of the military.
In January, the Air Force approved its first vaccine exemptions on religious grounds, granting nine waivers.
Vaccinations are par for the course in the military and at the Air Force Academy, where, in addition to the basic inoculations, cadets are required to get an annual flu shot.
Those few who’ve chosen not to get the COVID-19 vaccine say it’s the nature of the serum’s creation that sits ill with their faith.
“As a chaplain, I defend people’s religious freedom,” said former Colorado state Rep. Gordon Klingenschmitt, who graduated from the academy in 1991 and now leads an evangelical ministry in the Springs. “These are evangelical Christian cadets, who are pro-life, and they object to the fact that the vaccines were tested on aborted fetal stem cell lines. Because of their objection to abortion, their conscience will not let them … inject this particular drug into their own bodies.
“That’s why they won’t take the vaccine,” he said. “It’s not because they hate all vaccines.”
Klingenschmitt said the “retaliation” against cadets who’ve sought religious waivers runs counter to a promise AFA Superintendent Lt. Gen. Richard Clark made, soon after the policy went into effect in September 2021, at an academy reunion gathering, before a crowd of hundreds.
“I took a public microphone and said, ‘Will you advocate for religious cadets who refuse the vaccine? He said ‘Absolutely, chaplain,'” Klingenschmitt said. “In December, he did the opposite.”
Attorney Mike Rose said all of his clients submitted exemption requests that first were approved by the AFA chaplain.
“That’s another question: Why aren’t the chaplains, the religious leaders making that decision, rather than the superintendent?” Rose said.
The academy said that the consequences of cadets’ decisions to eschew the vaccine isn’t punishment for their beliefs. It’s the outcome of defying an order.
Lawsuits, including a class-action suit on behalf of Navy SEALs led by the Texas-based First Liberty Institute, are ongoing nation- and military-wide. A number of lawmakers also have taken up the fight, including U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas; U.S. Rep. Dan Crenshaw, R-Texas; and U.S. Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J., who has introduced a bill that would reinstate any service member dismissed because of vaccine status.
“Just spoke with a firstie’s grandfather, who said ‘If my grandson will not be allowed to graduate but is still in Air Force limbo until 2 August, sadly he must cancel his wedding on 11 June because cadets may not be married until they graduate,'” Klingenschmitt said. “Can you imagine how heartbroken his bride is?”
A rally is planned for Saturday morning at 9 a.m. at the South Gate of the Air Force Academy.
“We will have people waving signs and protesting to defend religious freedom,” Klingenschmitt said. “There’s only one person who can change his mind right now, and that is the superintendent, three-star Gen. Richard Clark. Our protest is to plea with him personally, ‘Sir, please keep your oath. Please let the cadets graduate. Defend their religious freedom.'”

by Jorge Gomez • 6 min read
On May 25, the U.S. Air Force Academy (USAFA) will hold a graduation ceremony for its 2022 class. However, it appears that several cadets will not be graduating, because they have religious objections to the military vaccine mandate. They requested a legal, religious accommodation and were denied.
According to the USAFA, the only options graduating seniors have are: “receive the vaccine” or “voluntarily resign.” But for those who have sincere religious objections to the vaccine, yet want to graduate and become Air Force officers, “they will face consequences.”
The punishment isn’t simply that they won’t be able to graduate, it also means they will not be commissioned as officers and may have to repay thousands of dollars in tuition, as much as $200,000 each. A USAFA spokesperson recently stated:
“If cadets choose to remain unvaccinated, they could be dismissed from the Academy. Depending on their year at the Academy, they could be required to reimburse the government for the costs of their education.”
The situation has garnered national attention, including that of U.S. Rep. Doug Lamborn, who criticized the Academy’s punitive approach. He argues that it penalizes the religious beliefs of the cadets and violates their First Amendment rights. The Congressman sent a letter to the USAFA Superintendent stating:
“These brave cadets who have been placed in your charge are being presented with an impossible choice: get vaccinated in violation of their religious beliefs, elect to voluntarily resign even though they aspire to service, or face legal action for disobeying a lawful order from a military that does not value their commitment.”
Rep. Lamborn also noted:
“America was founded on the principles of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, which encompasses protecting the religious rights of the individual. That includes those who put on the uniform and volunteer to serve our nation. It is imperative that our military leaders uphold the constitutional rights of these cadets…During a time when our military is facing serious recruitment and retention issues, the Department of Defense as a whole should not be discharging these highly trained individuals. I hope that the leadership at USAFA reconsiders this unconstitutional mandate and allows for reasonable accommodations to be provided to these cadets.”
The harsh and vindictive actions being taken against these cadets is outrageous. What’s happening to them, of course, is just the latest example of religious hostility in our military. The Department of Defense (DoD) and the Biden administration have constantly shown a particular disdain against service members of faith.
Rep. Lamborn joined more than 40 Representatives and Senators who filed a friend of the court brief in support of First Liberty’s 35 U.S. Navy SEAL clients. Like the cadets, they are also facing discrimination and punishment for their religious beliefs.
These elite warriors dedicated years of their lives to serving our nation. Each of them and their families made incredible sacrifices in order to keep America free. Collectively, our clients have more than 350 years of military service and more than 100 combat deployments. Not to mention, they’re the ones sent on some of the most dangerous missions, often in the most hostile areas around the world.
Shockingly, the DoD and the Biden administration are threatening their careers—all because they requested a legal, religious accommodation to the military vaccine mandate. For wanting to serve in accordance with their beliefs, these SEALs have been threatened with involuntary separation, denied from advancement opportunities and in some cases even denied medical care.
This mistreatment of our nation’s service members is outrageous and illegal. All service members are protected by federal law and military regulations, so they can serve our country without having to violate their religious beliefs. Forcing them to choose between their faith and serving their country dishonors the sacrifices they make to keep us free.
First Liberty continues fighting for our Navy SEALs. We’ve secured several key victories over the last several months. These wins have helped protect our clients from further punishment and, thanks to a class action, have extended protection to thousands of Navy personnel with religious objections to the mandate.
However, it’s clear from what’s happening to these Air Force cadets that the fight for religious freedom is far from over. Those who vehemently oppose religious expression in the military are constantly finding new ways to target anyone who wants to serve in a manner consistent with their faith.
This is Military Appreciation Month, and we encourage you to join First Liberty in the fight to restore and protect religious liberty for service members. The cases we’re fighting right now could have a major impact on the freedoms of our clients and thousands serving in the military. They need your support to help put a stop to the barrage of violations against their religious liberty.",en,Air Force Cadets Denied Graduation Due t,FAR RIGHT,,,,

WASHINGTON — Three cadets at the U.S. Air Force Academy who have refused the COVID-19 vaccine will not be commissioned as military officers but will graduate with bachelor's degrees, the academy said Saturday.
Academy spokesman Dean Miller said that a fourth cadet who had refused the vaccine until about a week ago, decided to be vaccinated and will graduate and become an Air Force officer.
In a statement, Miller said that while the three will get a degree ""they will not be commissioned into the United States Air Force as long as they remain unvaccinated."" He added that a decision on whether to require the three to reimburse the United States for education costs in lieu of service will be made by the secretary of the Air Force.
As of Saturday, the Air Force is the only military academy, so far, where cadets are not being commissioned due to vaccine refusal. All of the more than 1,000 Army cadets at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York, graduated and were commissioned as officers earlier in the day and all were vaccinated.
The Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, said Saturday that none of the Navy or Marine Corps seniors there are being prevented from commissioning due to vaccine refusals.

Ahead of that ceremony, the U.S. Air Force Academy Board conducted its standard review of whether this year's class had met all graduation requirements on Friday.
Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, who is the scheduled speaker at the Air Force graduation, last year made the COVID-19 vaccinations mandatory for service members, including those at the military academies, saying the vaccine is critical to maintaining military readiness and the health of the force.
Military leaders have argued that troops for decades have been required to get as many as 17 vaccines in order to maintain the health of the force, particularly those deploying overseas. Students arriving at the military academies get a regimen of shots on their first day — such as measles, mumps and rubella - if they aren’t already vaccinated. And they routinely get flu shots in the fall.
Members of Congress, the military, and the public have questioned if the exemption reviews by the military services have been fair. There have been multiple lawsuits filed against the mandate, mainly centering on the fact that very few service members have been granted religious exemptions from the shots.
Until the COVID-19 vaccine, very few military members sought religious exemptions to any vaccines.
Lt. Col. Brian Maguire, an Air Force Academy spokesman, said a week ago that all four of the cadets had been informed of the potential consequences and met with the academy’s superintendent. And he noted then that they still had time before graduation to change their minds - and one did.
The military academies for years have required students under certain circumstances to repay tuition costs if they leave during their junior or senior year. Often those cases involve students with disciplinary issues or similar problems. The costs can be as much as $200,000, or more, and any final decision on repayment is made by the service secretary.
Across the military, the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps have discharged as many as 4,000 active duty service members for refusing the vaccine. Those who flatly refuse the vaccine without seeking an exemption are still being discharged. But the courts have stalled additional discharges of service members who sought religious exemptions.

wng.org,https://wng.org/roundups/no-vaccine-no-graduation-1653404141,"Cadet Nathan Suess was looking forward to graduating from the Air Force Academy. After four years of intense academics, physical fitness, and military training, he would be a commissioned officer able to serve his country — just like his parents, Matt and Dana Suess. On May 11, that dream was put in jeopardy, as he and several other senior cadets were issued letters of reprimand over their refusal to obey an order directing them to take a COVID-19 vaccine.
Like all airmen, cadets are subject to an Air Force vaccine mandate issued last year. Nathan and the other cadets objected to the vaccines for religious reasons. In his request filed in November 2021, the first class cadet listed two religious objections: the use of aborted fetal cell lines in the development of the vaccines, and his unwillingness to participate in what he regarded as deceptions and untruths associated with the efficacy of the vaccine.
Three days before Christmas, Nathan’s request was denied. His superior officer cited the “compelling governmental interest of mission accomplishment, including military readiness, unit cohesion, good order and discipline, and the health and safety of all cadets.” A similar fate met his appeal, denied in a Feb. 23 memorandum. It asked Nathan to check one of two boxes: one indicating he would begin a vaccine regimen, the other indicating he would resign.
“He’s a very, very big rule follower,” said Dana Suess, describing her son’s anguish in not checking one of the two boxes, as required. “But it was even harder for him to go back on his convictions.” Dana Suess is a retired lieutenant in the Navy Nurse Corps, and Matt Suess is a retired commander in the Navy Civil Engineer Corps.
More than 200 of the 4,000 Air Force Academy cadets submitted requests for religious accommodation, according to Dana Suess. No religious accommodations were granted. Ultimately, facing pressure, virtually all cadets agreed to accept the vaccine. Of the four remaining, one resigned to attend another graduate program, Dana Suess said. Another cadet being treated for cancer agreed to accept the vaccine in order to retain military healthcare benefits, The (Colorado Springs, Colo.) Gazette reported. That left Nathan and one other cadet as the holdouts.
Mike Rose, an attorney in Summerville, S.C., representing Nathan Suess and cadets from lower classes said the controversy came to a head last week. Cadets were called to a meeting with the academy’s superintendent and told they would not graduate if they did not take the vaccine. They were also told they would be thrown out of the military and have to repay approximately $165,000 in tuition costs. Nathan would also be required to stay in the military until Aug. 1, forcing him to reschedule a planned June wedding.
Rose said that given the impending May 25 graduation date, he anticipates filing a lawsuit challenging the Air Force’s actions within days. He said the challenge would be rooted in the discriminatory treatment of religious objectors in the military, where officials have routinely denied religious claims but granted thousands of medical and administrative exemptions.
An Air Force spokesperson told The Gazette that the cadets were offered an opportunity to fly overseas to obtain a vaccine that was not developed using cell lines from aborted fetuses, yet all rejected it. According to Rose, they did not do so because the vaccine, Novavax, is not yet FDA approved, and he added that it was not even clear that it was legally available to them.
Two federal judges have already issued orders temporarily putting a hold on the disciplining of service members who have declined vaccines on religious grounds. In Ohio, U.S. District Judge Matthew McFarland sided with 18 airmen in a preliminary ruling at the end of March. “In this Court’s opinion, assuming the Constitution has taken a holiday, the holiday is long over, and it needs to get back to work, NOW,” McFarland wrote in an order protecting the airmen from being fired while litigation continues. “The Air Force has put these Airmen in the unconscionable position of choosing between their faith in an eternal God and their career in the United States military.”
In a May 3 filing, challengers also claim “whistleblowers” reported that at an October 2021 gathering of Air Force and Space Force senior leaders, a senior Air Force officer told attendees they were expected to reject COVID-19 religious exemption applications from any airmen “who would be remaining in the Department of the Air Force.” Over 200 additional airmen are seeking to join the lawsuit.
U.S. District Judge Steven Merryday in Florida criticized the Navy’s “rubber-stamp” denial of religious accommodation requests and entered an order temporarily barring the Navy from disciplining the service members.
Yet just last week, a Nebraska federal judge, in a 61-page opinion, sided with the military, refusing to exempt 36 members of the Air Force, Air Force Reserve, and Air National Guard who have religious objections to the COVID-19 vaccine mandate. U.S. District Judge Brian Buescher found the airmen were unlikely to succeed on their claim under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act or First Amendment. Those service members have filed an appeal.
In a statement Wednesday obtained by KKTV-11, the academy stood by its denial of the religious exemptions, noting that the two remaining cadet holdouts have until Aug. 1 to complete their vaccinations. The statement came one day after a letter from Rep. Doug Lamborn, R-Colo., who criticized the academy superintendent for penalizing cadets for vaccine refusal when neither West Point nor the U.S. Naval Academy had done so.
For Nathan, who has lived with the threat of being kicked out of the military for months, relief cannot come too soon. “All he ever wanted was to go to the Air Force Academy and serve his country,” said Dana Suess. “Now, he’s not even going to have a civil engineering degree … at least that’s at risk.”

The three cadets who refused to get the COVID-19 vaccine were told earlier this month they had the option of getting the shot or not receiving a degree or commission after graduation. There was a fourth cadet who decided to get vaccinated before Wednesday’s graduation. The other three cadets will receive degrees from the academy, but they will not receive a commission.
MUSTACHE MEMO: AIR FORCE COULD ALLOW AIRMEN TO GROW MORE FACIAL HAIR
Besides not receiving a commission, the secretary of the Air Force will determine whether the three cadets will have to reimburse the United States for the cost of their education because they won’t be serving.
The Air Force Academy is the only military school refusing to commission graduates who aren’t vaccinated, according to the Associated Press.
Vaccine requirements have bedeviled the Air Force since Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin instituted them last year.
The Supreme Court has largely stayed out of disputes between service members and military branches.
Last month, the court said it wouldn’t get involved in a vaccine mandate challenge brought by an Air Force Reserve lieutenant colonel who said he refused the vaccine on religious grounds. The court didn’t say why it wouldn’t take up Lt. Col. Jonathan Dunn’s case.

This is in addition to eight other vaccines required of cadets.
Superintendent of the US Air Force Academy Lt. General Richard M. Clark decided their religious exemption requests do not outweigh the requirement of a safe and ready military force.
However, if they commit to the vaccine regimen and are fully vaccinated by August 1, the cadets can graduate next week as commissioned officers.
If they do not, and leave the service, the cadets must pay back their taxpayer-funded tuition.
Congressman Doug Lamborn has written to the superintendent arguing to allow the cadets to graduate. A release from his office states, ""Not only does this decision penalize the religious beliefs of these cadets, and violate their First Amendment rights, but it also upholds a requirement that is currently subject to numerous unresolved lawsuits.""

kktv.com,https://www.kktv.com/2022/05/18/rep-lamborn-asks-air-force-academy-let-cadets-refusing-covid-vaccine-graduate/,"COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (KKTV) - U.S. Rep. Doug Lamborn is expressing his dismay that a small number of Air Force Academy cadets may not be allowed to graduate because of their refusal to get the COVID-19 vaccine.
“I was extremely disappointed to hear that the United States Air Force Academy is planning to deny these ... cadets the opportunity to graduate and serve our nation because of their request to uphold their tightly held religious beliefs,” Lamborn said in a letter to the AFA superintendent Tuesday, asking him to change his mind.
The Pentagon made the COVID vaccine mandatory for all service members last year, including those at military academies. Military leaders have pointed out that there is nothing unique about this requirement; the Department of Defense currently requires at least nine vaccinations for people entering the military, and up to 17 depending on the service member’s job or where/if they are deploying.
According to a report by the Associated Press, very few military members sought religious exemptions to any vaccines until the COVID-19 shot.
Originally, four members of the Air Force Academy’s senior class refused the COVID vaccine, leaving them at risk of not being able to graduate or be commissioned, as well as pay back thousands of dollars in tuition if nothing changed before graduation day on May 25. A spokesperson for the academy says that one of the four finally decided to get the vaccine and another submitted paperwork to resign from the school, leaving two cadets at a stalemate over the vaccine graduation policy.
The AFA is the only military academy currently facing this issue with its Class of 2022.
The academy released a statement to 11 News Wednesday:
“Two senior cadets are refusing to obey the Secretary of Defense’s lawful order from August 2021 to receive vaccination against COVID-19. This vaccine requirement is in addition to the eight other vaccines required of all individuals for accession into the military. This refusal, if it continues, may impact their ability to graduate and commission. Cadets with health and religious concerns were given the opportunity to follow Air Force policy in requesting accommodation based on their faith traditions or medical condition. Part of that religious accommodation process included an interview with a chaplain who determined if the cadet had a sincerely held religious belief. However, even if an individual holds a sincerely held religious belief, the decision authority, in this instance the Superintendent, must weigh that belief against the compelling government interest of ensuring a safe and ready force – crucial to meet global deployment responsibilities.
“We provided resources and information to the cadets in order to make a decision and graduate with the Class of 2022. The majority of our religious accommodation requests centered on the use of stem cells in the development and/or production of the currently available vaccines. There are vaccines available that did not use stem cells in the development, testing or production, which was presented as an option. The cadets refused to commit to this vaccine. Another USAFA staff member used their own resources to obtain the Novavax vaccine and is now in compliance with DoD policy. We have taken every step and continued to work to protect the religious freedom of our cadets and staff. These cadets are not out of time. If they start a vaccine regimen and commit to finishing it according to the FDA/CDC recommendations, they can graduate and commission with the rest of the class on May 25. They must be fully vaccinated by Aug. 1. We want to see these cadets graduate and commission, but they must meet the military requirements necessary for a ready force.”
Lamborn says the AFA’s refusal to let the cadets graduate sans vaccine is violating their First Amendment rights.
“America was founded on the principles of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, which encompasses protecting the religious rights of the individual. That includes those who put on the uniform and volunteer to serve our nation. It is imperative that our military leaders uphold the constitutional rights of these cadets.”
The congressman has been fighting the military COVID vaccine mandate for the last six months.
His full letter to the AFA superintendent on the graduation issue can be read below: (Editor’s note: The letter still lists the number of cadets as four, but as stated above, the Air Force Academy confirmed with 11 News Wednesday that the number is now two.)

Academy spokesperson Dean Miller said in a statement that the three cadets in question won’t be commissioned as air force officers “as long as they remain unvaccinated,” though they would get their bachelor’s of science degrees. The military branch had not decided yet whether to require the trio to reimburse the US for education costs in lieu of service, Miller said.
A fourth cadet who had initially turned down the shot providing protection against Covid-19 ultimately got vaccinated and would graduate with an officer’s commission, Miller added.
The air force academy didn’t identify any of the cadets who were denied officers’ commissions.
The statements from Miller were a reminder that the air force’s was the only US military academy as of now who was preventing its cadets from being commissioned as officers because of vaccine refusals.
Each of the 1,000 cadets who graduated from the US army’s academy at West Point, New York, on Saturday had been vaccinated and would be commissioned. Meanwhile, officials at the Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, told the Associated Press that none of its Navy or Marine Corps graduates would be blocked from their commissions due to vaccine refusal when their commencement ceremonies occur in the coming weeks.
The air force’s graduation ceremony is scheduled for Wednesday. Chosen as keynote speaker was US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, who made Covid-19 vaccines mandatory for military service members and academy students last year.
Austin reasoned that the vaccine was key to keeping the military healthy and ready for action, noting that service members have previously been required to get more than a dozen vaccines for illnesses such as measles, mumps and rubella.
Though Congress members, military officials, members of the public and unsuccessful litigation have questioned whether requests to be exempt from the mandate have been treated fairly, the vast majority of military members have been vaccinated against Covid-19 at least once.
About 99% of those actively serving the Navy, and 98% of the air force, Marine Corps and Army have gotten at least one shot, officials have said.
Nonetheless, the air force last year had to discharge at least 27 people who refused to get the Covid-19 shot and were believed to be the first service members to be dismissed for disobeying Austin’s vaccine mandate.",en,US air force academy cadets denied commission over vaccine refusal,LEFT-CENTER,MIXED,MEDIUM CREDIBILITY,,

The Air Force Academy is the only military academy so far to announce penalties for a failure to get vaccinated. The Army and Navy said their seniors are not being barred from this month's graduation over their vaccination status.
WHO REPORTS COVID CASES DOWN EVERYWHERE BUT AFRICA, AMERICAS
Air Force Academy spokesman Lt. Col. Brian Maguire said the graduation is two weeks away and that the cadets still have time to ""weigh their options."" There are also two juniors, one sophomore and six freshmen at the academy to have refused the COVID vaccine.
Last year, the Pentagon announced a vaccine mandate for service members, including for those at military academies. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the vaccine is crucial to the military's health and readiness.
""To defend this Nation, we need a healthy and ready force,"" Austin wrote in an August memo. ""After careful consultation with medical experts and military leadership, and with the support of the President, I have determined that mandatory vaccination against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is necessary to protect the Force and defend the American people.""
Military leaders have said service members have long been required to get a number of other vaccines to ensure the health of the force. Students at the military academies who are not already vaccinated receive several shots on their first day, including shots for measles, mumps and Rubella, and they get annual flu shots in the fall.
SOUTH KOREA PLANS TO SEND VACCINES TO CORONAVIRUS-STRICKEN NORTH KOREA
The military's vaccine exemption reviews have been questioned by members of Congress, the military and the public regarding the fairness of the reviews.
There have also been multiple lawsuits filed over opposition to the vaccine mandate, with the main focus being the fact that very few religious exemptions had been granted.
The military academies have required students to repay tuition costs under certain circumstances in the past if they leave during their junior or senior year. Those instances often involve students with disciplinary issues. A final decision on repayment is made by the service secretary.
The Marine Corps, Navy, Army and Air Force have discharged nearly 4,000 active duty service members over their refusal to get vaccinated. Recent data released by the services shows that more than 2,100 Marines, 900 sailors, 500 Army soldiers and 360 airmen have been discharged. At least 50 service members were discharged during entry level training.

According to Maguire, the four cadets — who are not named — have been informed of the potential consequences, and have met with the academy’s superintendent. In addition to those four, there are two juniors, one sophomore and six freshmen at the academy who have also refused the vaccine.
The military academies for years have required students under certain circumstances to repay tuition costs if they leave during their junior or senior year. Often those involve students with disciplinary issues or similar problems. The costs can be as much as $200,000, or more, and any final decision on repayment is made by the service secretary.
West Point said that there are no members of the Class of 2022 who have refused to get the vaccine.
Across the military, the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps have discharged nearly 4,000 active duty service members for refusing the vaccine. According to recent data released by the services, more than 2,100 Marines, 900 sailors, 500 Army soldiers and 360 airmen have been thrown out of the military, and at least 50 were discharged during entry level training, before they moved into active duty service.
Those who flatly refuse the vaccine without seeking an exemption are still being discharged. But the courts have stalled additional discharges of service members who sought religious exemptions.
Last month, a federal judge in Texas barred the Navy from taking action for now against sailors who have objected to being vaccinated on religious grounds.
U.S. District Judge Reed O’Connor had, in January, issued a preliminary injunction preventing the Navy from disciplining or discharging 35 sailors who sued over the Navy’s vaccine policy while their case played out. In April, O’Connor agreed the case could go forward as a class action suit and issued a preliminary injunction covering about 4,000 sailors who have objected on religious grounds to being vaccinated.
Also last month, a federal judge in Ohio granted a preliminary injunction blocking the Air Force from disciplining a dozen officers and some additional airmen and reservists who were seeking religious exemptions. The officers, mostly from Wright-Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton, Ohio, sued in February after their exemption requests were denied.
According to the military, as many as 20,000 service members have asked for religious exemptions. Thousands have been denied.
As of recent data, the Air Force has approved 73 religious exemptions, the Marine Corps has approved seven, and the Army has approved eight. Before the injunction, the Navy conditionally approved one reservist and 26 active-duty requests for religious exemptions, and 10 requests from members of the Individual Ready Reserve. The IRR approvals mean that those sailors don’t have to be vaccinated until they are actually called to serve.
About 99 percent of the active-duty Navy and 98 percent of the Air Force, Marine Corps and Army have gotten at least one shot.

airforcetimes.com,https://www.airforcetimes.com/news/your-air-force/2022/05/15/4-air-force-cadets-may-not-graduate-due-to-vaccine-refusal/,"Four cadets at the Air Force Academy may not graduate or be commissioned as military officers this month because they have refused the COVID-19 vaccine, and they may be required to pay back thousands of dollars in tuition costs, according to Air Force officials.
It’s the only military academy, so far, where cadets may face such penalties. The Army and Navy said that as of now, not one of their seniors is being prevented from graduating at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York, or the Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, due to vaccine refusals. The graduations are in about two weeks.

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin last year made the COVID-19 vaccinations mandatory for service members, including those at the military academies, saying the vaccine is critical to maintaining military readiness and the health of the force.
Military leaders have argued that troops for decades have been required to get as many as 17 vaccines in order to maintain the health of the force, particularly those deploying overseas. Students arriving at the military academies get a regimen of shots on their first day — such as measles, mumps and rubella - if they aren’t already vaccinated. And they routinely get regular flu shots in the fall.
Members of Congress, the military and the public have questioned if the exemption reviews by the military services have been fair. There have been multiple lawsuits filed against the mandate, mainly centering on the fact that very few service members have been granted religious exemptions from the shots.

Klingenschmitt, an Air Force Academy graduate and former U.S. Navy chaplain, told ""Fox & Friends First"" hosts Ashley Strohmier and Todd Piro Monday that the issue is not about the vaccine, but is instead about the cadets' ""religious freedom"" and their ""First Amendment rights.""
Klingenschmitt said the cadets applied for a religious exemption to the vaccine because it was allegedly tested on aborted baby parts.
AIR FORCE CADETS MAY NOT GRADUATE AFTER REFUSING COVID VACCINE
""That violates their conscience,"" he said. ""The three-star General Richard Clark, at the Air Force Academy, rejected their applications…""
Klingenschmitt then displayed Clark's memo which denied the cadets' religious waivers.
""Four of the firsties [the senior cadets] were brought into [Clark's] office on Tuesday and they were told three things: You're not going to be allowed to graduate, we're giving you a letter of reprimand, and you will be forced to repay between $200,000 and $400,000 in back scholarship money…"" he said.
Strohmier asked Klingenschmitt how issues surrounding freedom of religion are allowed to continue and where everyone should place the blame.
""There is a religious purge against Christians in the military,"" he said. ""It starts at the top. The Biden administration is allowing this DOD policy…""
After some back-and-forth with the White House spokesperson who denied any involvement and labeled the issue an ""Air Force policy,"" Klingenschmitt decided to go ""right to the source.""
""I interviewed the 3-star general superintendent Richard Clark at my class reunion in September… on stage, before eyewitnesses, on video he said ‘absolutely, I’ll protect religious freedom, I'll defend the Constitution for my cadets who have a religious objection.' Now he has broken his word…""

I have been very vocal against the United States Air Force Academy (my alma mater) for its corrupt teaching of cultural Marxism and its Covid ‘vaccine’ mandates.
However, the recent actions of Superintendent Richard Clark, in forcing a cadet who is a cancer survivor and was advised to not take the Covid gene serum by his medical advisors (military and civilian), is simply beyond the pale.
One of those four cadets took the Pfizer COVID vaccine the next day, even though:
He had been on “turnback” status away from the AF Academy for a year due to his having been treated for cancer with chemotherapy, etc.; and Both a military doctor and a civilian doctor had told him recently he should not take the Pfizer COVID vaccine due to risks due to his medical history.
General Clark is using the excuse ‘he is just following orders’. The excuse didn’t work during the Nuremberg trial after the fall of the Third Reich, and it doesn’t work now.
I have personally spoken to parents of cadets, and incoming cadets, who stated Clark’s office informed them ‘they were just following orders from above’.
General Clark, as well as the Department of Defense leadership, will eventually be held accountable for their actions in a courtroom.
It is now obvious, General Clark (my classmate) is working against the United States of America, for which he took an oath to serve.
He is betraying his oath and should resign immediately.
The ‘vaccines’ are not vaccines. They are gene-altering compounds.
They don’t stop transmission of Covid; in fact, the evidence shows they enhance transmission. All you have to do is look at the ‘highly-vaxed’ areas and their rate of infection to understand this.
The ‘vaccines’ are deadly to many. All you have to do is look at the Pfizer documents a judge forced the Pharma company to release to understand this. 1,200 dead in the first month? Let’s ‘vaccinate’ everyone!
There is no benefit for young, healthy individuals to take the ‘vaccine’. There is only risk. College-aged individuals have zero chance of dying from Covid, unless they have comorbidities, like a history of cancer.
In fact, evidence has shown the vaccines can ‘activate’ cancers in remission due to destruction of the human body’s immune system.
Yet, Clark forces ‘vaccination’.
Clark issues illegal orders that have and will harm the personnel under him.
Clark forces cadets to follow illegal orders.
The vaccines are a control mechanism to purge the force of religious service members, conservatives, and to weaken the force for Biden, who works for Xi Jinping.

military.com,https://www.military.com/daily-news/2022/05/25/austin-tells-air-force-academy-grads-be-honorable-following-schools-cheating-vaccine-scandals.html,"Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin told students at the Air Force Academy graduation Wednesday to serve their community and be honorable, a message that comes as the service academy deals with the aftermath of a widespread cheating scandal and vaccine refusals among cadets.
During his speech in Colorado Springs, Austin said the country will expect a lot of the new airmen and Guardians.
""We're here to defend America's security and win America's wars,"" Austin said. ""But we're also here to safeguard America's values. So that means a love of service to your classmates, to your community and to your country. It means that you will never lie, cheat or steal.""
Read Next: 22 Cadets Leave, Hundreds Put on Probation After 2020 Air Force Academy Cheating Scandal
Austin's advice to not ""lie, cheat or steal"" comes after it was revealed last month that 22 students were expelled or chose to resign from the academy after widespread cheating in 2020, when the school transitioned to remote learning during the pandemic.
In total, 245 students were suspected of cheating, and 231 of them admitted they had violated the school's honor code.
Of those, 210 cadets were put on six-month probation and could not represent the academy at any sporting events or competitions nor participate in any school clubs. They also were required to undergo additional ethics training and instruction.
Every student who was placed on probation has since completed it.
Austin also mentioned how the COVID-19 pandemic took a toll on the world, as well as the aspiring military officers at the academy.
""Graduating from this academy is hard enough without a global pandemic,"" he said. ""And graduating after years of being clouded by COVID shows serious courage and character, and I know it's been a time of challenge and loss for many of you. ... What counts is how you respond to hard times.""
Late last week, the Air Force Academy announced that three cadets who had refused to get vaccinated against COVID-19 would be allowed to graduate from the service academy but would not join the ranks.
""While they will receive a degree, they will not be commissioned into the United States Air Force as long as they remain unvaccinated,"" a press release from the academy said.
A four-year education at the Air Force Academy is valued at $416,000, according to the school's website. In the past, the academy has had cadets repay their tuition if they leave by their junior or senior year or under some disciplinary circumstances.
It's not yet clear whether the three cadets who are refusing to get vaccinated will have to reimburse the academy.
""A decision to reimburse the United States for education costs in lieu of service will be made by the Secretary of the Air Force,"" the Air Force Academy said in a press release last week.
On Wednesday, 957 cadets graduated from the service academy -- 863 were commissioned into the Air Force, and 94 were commissioned into the Space Force.
""You have answered our country's call, with courage and commitment, with tenacity and teamwork, with strength and sacrifice,"" Austin said. ""With outstanding leaders like the class of 2022, the future of our country is bright.""

breitbart.com,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2022/02/02/army-to-immediately-begin-separating-soldiers-not-complying-with-vaccine-mandate/,"The Army announced Wednesday morning that it will “immediately” begin discharging soldiers who have not complied with the Biden administration’s order for all service members to be vaccinated against the coronavirus.
Army Secretary Christine Wormuth issued a directive to commanders to initiate the separations (discharges) against any soldier who has not complied with the vaccination order and does not have a pending or approved exemption request, the Army said. The order applies to active duty members and reservists on federal active-duty orders, as well as cadets.
“Army readiness depends on Soldiers who are prepared to train, deploy, fight and win our nation’s wars,” Wormuth said, according to an Army press release. “Unvaccinated Soldiers present risk to the force and jeopardize readiness. We will begin involuntary separation proceedings for Soldiers who refuse the vaccine order and are not pending a final decision on an exemption.”
Wormuth’s directive, Army Directive 2022-02, says commanders are to begin separation proceedings as expeditiously as possible. Soldiers “will not be eligible for involuntary separation pay, and may even be subject to recoupment of any unearned special or incentive pays.”
The directive said, “[S]oldiers who will complete their separation or retirement, or begin transition leave, on or before July 1, 2022, will be granted a temporary exemption and allowed to complete their separations or retirements.”
The service members will be separated under honorable conditions, in line with a provision in the 2022 National Defense Authorization Act. Republicans fought to make sure soldiers would not be discharged with anything lower than that, while the Biden administration wanted to keep the option of dishonorable discharges.
However, the Army said soldiers would receive an honorable discharge unless “additional misconduct warrants separation with an Other than Honorable characterization of service.”
The Army said soldiers who receive denials of their exemption requests will have seven calendar days to begin vaccination, or to submit an appeal to the final appeal authority. If that appeal is denied, the soldier has seven days to begin vaccination or be separated.
The Army has so far fired six active duty Army leaders, including two battalion commanders, and has issued 3,073 general officer written reprimands to those who have declined to be vaccinated.
The separations of potentially thousands of soldiers comes as the Army has struggled to meet its recruiting goals. The Army fell short of meeting its October and November 2021 goals by several thousand, according to CNN.
The goal was 10,400 new members, but the Army recruited only 7,340 new members. The mandate had just gotten started in late August, with a deadline of December 15 for active-duty soldiers.
Former President Donald Trump recently called on Republicans, if they retake control of Congress, to pass legislation that would allow for separated service members to rejoin the military, as Breitbart recently reported.
The Marine Corps has separated at least 399 members, the Navy at least 45, and the Air Force at least 111.

AIR FORCE ACADEMY, Colo. — Three cadets at the U.S. Air Force Academy who have refused the COVID-19 vaccine will not be commissioned as military officers but will graduate with bachelor's degrees, the academy said Saturday.
Academy spokesman Dean Miller said that a fourth cadet who had refused the vaccine until about a week ago decided to be vaccinated and will graduate and become an Air Force officer.
In a statement, Miller said that while the three will get a degree ""they will not be commissioned into the United States Air Force as long as they remain unvaccinated.""
He added that a decision on whether to require the three to reimburse the United States for education costs in lieu of service will be made by the secretary of the Air Force.
As of Saturday, the Air Force is the only military academy, so far, where cadets are not being commissioned due to vaccine refusal. All of the more than 1,000 Army cadets at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York, graduated and were commissioned as officers earlier in the day and all were vaccinated.
The Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, said Saturday that none of the Navy or Marine Corps seniors there are being prevented from commissioning due to vaccine refusals.
That graduation is later this week, and the Air Force ceremony is Wednesday.
Ahead of that ceremony, the U.S. Air Force Academy Board conducted its standard review of whether this year's class had met all graduation requirements on Friday.
Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, who is the scheduled speaker at the Air Force graduation, last year made the COVID-19 vaccinations mandatory for service members, including those at the military academies, saying the vaccine is critical to maintaining military readiness and the health of the force.

Three graduating cadets with the US Air Force won't be commissioned as military officers after refusing to get vaccinated for COVID-19, the Associated Press reported.
""They will not be commissioned into the United States Air Force as long as they remain unvaccinated,"" Spokesman Dean Miller told the AP.

Miller added that the secretary of the Air Force will decide if the three cadets need to reimburse the US for their educational costs. Air Force officials initially told the AP last week that the four cadets may not graduate and may owe tuition costs. The costs can add up to more than $200,000.

legalinsurrection.com,https://legalinsurrection.com/2022/05/four-u-s-air-force-academy-cadets-may-not-graduate-be-commissioned-after-refusing-covid-vaccine/,"This weekend, the country is facing a surge of covid cases. Early reports indicate that the increasing number of cases is not leading to a rise in hospitalizations.
The U.S. reported nearly 140,000 Covid-19 cases on Wednesday, marking the third day in a row daily cases have exceeded 100,000, according to an NBC News tally. Nationwide, cases have climbed by roughly 58 percent over the past two weeks as the omicron coronavirus subvariant BA.2 and an offshoot of that strain, called BA.2.12.1, continue to spread. The last time confirmed cases exceeded 100,000 was in mid-February, when the winter surge, fueled by the original omicron variant, BA.1, began to subside. However, in the Northeast, where the vast majority of cases are being reported, the rate of hospitalizations and deaths aren’t as high as expected, a senior administration official told NBC News earlier this week.
This is as I projected based on past histories of coronavirus infections: There will be waves of infections until population immunity builds up and the virus joins the others in the standard cold suite of pathogens.
Furthermore, as I have noted in my coverage of the Gridiron Dinner and White House Correspondents Dinner, leading politicians and celebrities who have been vaccinated and boosted have come down with covid.
Furthermore, earlier this year, Gen. Mark Milley (Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff) and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin both came down with covid . . . despite being vaccinated.
Given that the illness is usually mild in the young and healthy, the failure of the vaccines to protect from infection, and the increase in political tensions across the globe, you might think that destroying the careers of promising young officers before they launched would be….unwise.
However, different choices are made when virtual signaling is more important than strategic military planning.
Four Air Force Academy cadets may not graduate or be commissioned as military officers this month, and could be forced to pay back thousands in tuition, after they refused to get vaccinated against the coronavirus, Air Force officials said. The Air Force Academy is the only military academy so far to announce penalties for a failure to get vaccinated. The Army and Navy said their seniors are not being barred from this month’s graduation over their vaccination status. Air Force Academy spokesman Lt. Col. Brian Maguire said the graduation is two weeks away and that the cadets still have time to “weigh their options.” There are also two juniors, one sophomore and six freshmen at the academy to have refused the COVID vaccine. Last year, the Pentagon announced a vaccine mandate for service members, including for those at military academies. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the vaccine is crucial to the military’s health and readiness.
The four cadets all applied for religious exemptions to refuse the vaccine, but their applications had been denied. Advocates for the college seniors say they should be allowed to refuse the vaccine on religious grounds.
Former Colorado State Rep. Gordon Klingenschmitt, for example, labeled the unnamed students ‘evangelical Christian cadets, who are pro-life, and they object to the fact that the vaccines were tested on aborted fetal stem cell lines. ‘Because of their objection to abortion, their conscience will not let them … inject this particular drug into their own bodies,’ he told the Gazette. ‘That’s why they won’t take the vaccine,’ he continued. ‘It’s not because they hate all vaccines.’ Klingenschmitt has now planned a rally outside of the Air Force Academy north of Colorado Springs, saying: ‘There’s only one person who can change his mind right now, and that is the superintendent, three-star Gen. Richard Clark. ‘Our protest is to plea with him personally, “Sir, please keep your oath. Please let the cadets graduate. Defend their religious freedom.”
I argue that the vaccines are, at best, useless . . . especially for young, healthy adults and because the variants are no more hazardous than bad flu in the worst-case scenario. Therefore, the decision for this vaccination should be based on the individual’s preference.

The Academy's board conducted a ""standard review"" and recommended that the three seniors receive Bachelor of Science degrees, according to a press release from the school.
But the Academy also said they ""will not be commissioned into the United States Air Force as long as they remain unvaccinated"" and that Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall will determine if the graduates will be required to ""reimburse the United States for education costs in lieu of service.""
And while the graduates will be awarded their degrees, they will not be permitted to attend the May 25 graduation ceremony.
AIR FORCE CADETS MAY NOT GRADUATE AFTER REFUSING COVID VACCINE
""That has been confirmed and is petty, vindictive, disrespectful and unnecessary,"" attorney Mike Rose, who represents one of the unvaccinated cadets, told The Washington Times.
This comes after Air Force officials said earlier this month that four cadets may not graduate or be commissioned as military officers, and that they could be forced to pay back thousands in tuition. The fourth graduate opted to get vaccinated, and will now graduate and become an Air Force officer.
The Pentagon announced last year a vaccine mandate for service members, including for those at military academies.
AIR FORCE CADETS FACE EXPULSION OVER VACCINE MANDATE
""To defend this Nation, we need a healthy and ready force,"" Defense Secretary Loyd Austin wrote in an August memo . ""After careful consultation with medical experts and military leadership, and with the support of the President, I have determined that mandatory vaccination against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is necessary to protect the Force and defend the American people.""
The fairness of the military's vaccine exemption reviews have been questioned by members of Congress, the military and the public, and multiple lawsuits have been filed over opposition to the mandate, centered primarily on the fact that very few religious exemptions had been granted.
The Marine Corps, Navy, Army and Air Force have discharged nearly 4,000 active duty service members over their refusal to get vaccinated. Recent data from the services shows that more than 2,100 Marines, 900 sailors, 500 Army soldiers and 360 airmen have been discharged. At least 50 service members were discharged during entry-level training.
CDC RECOMMENDS PFIZER BOOSTER SHOT FOR CHILDREN 5 TO 11
Service members who have refused the vaccine without seeking an exemption are still being discharged while the discharges of those involved in lawsuits are held up amid the legal battles.
The military has said that as many as 20,000 service members have requested a religious exemption and that thousands of such applications have been denied.

Academy spokesman Dean Miller said that a fourth cadet who had refused the vaccine until about a week ago, decided to be vaccinated and will graduate and become an Air Force officer.
In a statement, Miller said that while the three will get a degree “they will not be commissioned into the United States Air Force as long as they remain unvaccinated.” He added that a decision on whether to require the three to reimburse the United States for education costs in lieu of service will be made by the secretary of the Air Force.
As of Saturday, the Air Force is the only military academy, so far, where cadets are not being commissioned due to vaccine refusal. All of the more than 1,000 Army cadets at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York, graduated and were commissioned as officers earlier in the day and all were vaccinated.
The Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, said Saturday that none of the Navy or Marine Corps seniors there are being prevented from commissioning due to vaccine refusals. That graduation is later this week, and the Air Force ceremony is Wednesday in Colorado. Ahead of that ceremony, the U.S. Air Force Academy Board conducted its standard review of whether this year’s class had met all graduation requirements on Friday.
Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, who is the scheduled speaker at the Air Force graduation, last year made the COVID-19 vaccinations mandatory for service members, including those at the military academies, saying the vaccine is critical to maintaining military readiness and the health of the force.

Military leaders have argued that troops for decades have been required to get as many as 17 vaccines in order to maintain the health of the force, particularly those deploying overseas. Students arriving at the military academies get a regimen of shots on their first day — such as measles, mumps and rubella - if they aren’t already vaccinated. And they routinely get flu shots in the fall.
Members of Congress, the military, and the public have questioned if the exemption reviews by the military services have been fair. There have been multiple lawsuits filed against the mandate, mainly centering on the fact that very few service members have been granted religious exemptions from the shots.
Until the COVID-19 vaccine, very few military members sought religious exemptions to any vaccines.
Lt. Col. Brian Maguire, an Air Force Academy spokesman, said a week ago that all four of the cadets had been informed of the potential consequences and met with the academy’s superintendent. And he noted then that they still had time before graduation to change their minds - and one did.
The military academies for years have required students under certain circumstances to repay tuition costs if they leave during their junior or senior year. Often those cases involve students with disciplinary issues or similar problems. The costs can be as much as $200,000, or more, and any final decision on repayment is made by the service secretary.
Across the military, the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps have discharged as many as 4,000 active duty service members for refusing the vaccine. Those who flatly refuse the vaccine without seeking an exemption are still being discharged. But the courts have stalled additional discharges of service members who sought religious exemptions.
According to the military, as many as 20,000 service members have asked for religious exemptions. Thousands have been denied.

Air Force Academy spokesman Dean Miller shared the information in a statement.
Miller said that the three cadets “will not be commissioned into the United States Air Force as long as they remain unvaccinated.”
A fourth cadet was previously listed among those excluded but has since decided to be vaccinated in order to become an officer.
The Air Force is the only military academy currently refusing to commission cadets due to COVID-19 non-compliance, according to the Associated Press.
The incident is the most recent development in the ongoing controversy regarding COVID-19 vaccinations and Armed Forces personnel.
Earlier this month, Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz and 13 additional GOP senators introduced a new bill to protect military service members from punishment for declining the COVID-19 vaccine.
The Allowing Military Exemptions, Recognizing Individual Concerns About New Shots (AMERICANS) Act of 2022 is designed to counter the Biden administration’s efforts to coerce and punish Armed Forces personnel, including accountability measures to increase transparency.
Last month, defense officials told Congress that about 3,400 troops had been involuntarily separated from service for refusing the mandated vaccine, according to the Military Times.
“Of that group, about 70% have received general discharges, a designation that allows them to receive most veterans benefits and potentially rejoin the military at a later date,” the report noted. “The other 30% have received honorable discharges. Congress last year forbade military leaders from issuing dishonorable discharges for vaccine refusal.”
The Air Force Times reported that across the military, the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps had discharged close to 4,000 active duty service members for refusing the vaccine. In addition, several thousand more remain on hold pending cases related to religious exemption requests.
Colorado Republican Rep. Doug Lamborn, whose district includes the Air Force Academy, expressed his concern.
“I was extremely disappointed to hear that the United States Air Force Academy is planning to deny these four cadets the opportunity to graduate and serve our nation because of their request to uphold their tightly held religious beliefs,” Lamborn said in a statement.
“America was founded on the principles of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, which encompasses protecting the religious rights of the individual. That includes those who put on the uniform and volunteer to serve our nation. It is imperative that our military leaders uphold the constitutional rights of these cadets,” he added.
The American Military News also noted that the cadets could be forced to pay back nearly $200,000 in government scholarship money, though the decisions in the individual cases have yet to be determined.",en,"Air Force Cadets To Receive Degree, No Commission Over COVID-19 Vaccine Refusal",RIGHT,MIXED,MEDIUM CREDIBILITY,,
krdo.com,https://krdo.com/news/2022/05/17/four-u-s-air-force-academy-cadets-denied-graduation-for-refusing-covid-19-vaccine/,"U.S. AIR FORCE ACADEMY, Colo. (KRDO) -- The United State Air Force Academy (USAFA) Class of 2022 Graduation Ceremony is a little over a week away on May 25. However, four senior cadets will not be graduating due to their vaccination status.
According to the USAFA, 13 students have not received the COVID-19 vaccine, four of those are seniors, two are juniors, one is a sophomore, and six are freshmen.
According to Dean Miller with the USAFA, the only option graduating seniors have is, ""to obey the lawful order and receive the vaccine. Another option is they can elect to voluntarily resign. Otherwise, they will face consequences for disobeying a lawful order.""
All 13 cadets applied for a religious accommodation, and all were denied. Including the application of Senior Air Force Cadet Nathan Suess, a civil engineering major.
Tuesday, 13 Investigates spoke with Nathan's father, Matt about his vaccine refusal.
Nathan Suess
""He said 'no this is wrong and unlawful,'"" Suess said. ""Nathan heard nothing from them for months.""
Suess said his son's religious accommodation was denied in late December. Then, his son applied for an appeal and did not hear back from the Air Force Academy until late March, when it was then denied as well.
""He was told he won't graduate. He won't be commissioned and he's been served the first step in disciplinary paperwork, a letter of reprimand,"" Suess told 13 Investigates.
Suess said his son's future has been turned upside down. According to Seuss, Nathan had a wedding planned for two weeks post-graduation and a deployment plan near where his future bride resides.
""He's under tremendous pressure and lots of people just say give in, but he wrestling with it,"" Suess said. ""He knows this is wrong, it's immoral, it's illegal but the Academy is not letting up.""
The USAFA did tell 13 Investigates that cadets have known since November about the requirements.
In a statement to 13 Investigates, a spokesperson for the Air Force Academy said the four cadets have no other options but to receive the COVID-19 vaccine.
""To obey the lawful order and receive the vaccine. Another option is they can elect to voluntarily resign. Otherwise, they will face consequences for disobeying a lawful order. U.S. Air Force Academy Spokesperson
According to Suess, his son has also been told he has to pay back around $160,000 in education costs if he refuses the vaccine.
""We are looking into legal recourse to fight this because it is an injustice,"" Suess said.
Suess is a 21-year Navy veteran himself. His wife and bother in-laws are also veterans.
""We are a military family through and through and I am so profoundly disappointed in our military, with how they have handled this,"" Suess said.
The USAFA told 13 Investigates each religious exemption is handled on a case-by-case basis and the accommodation waiver process adheres to the Department of Defense and Department of the Air Force guidance and ""respects the religious rights of each cadet.""
The USAFA's medical exemption guidance is provided by the Defense Health Agency, which oversees medical requirements for the DoD.
According to the Air Force Academy, all cadets agree to these enrollment agreements:
4.3.1. Upon entry to the Academy, basic cadets must sign an agreement stating if they are subsequently disenrolled or resign during their second- or first-class year, they may be required to either:
4.3.1.1. Serve on active duty as an enlisted member in the Regular Air Force, Space Force, or Air Force Reserve for a period of time not to exceed 4 years, or 4.3.1.2. Reimburse the United States for education costs when it is determined that fulfillment of the active duty service obligation by the cadet would not be in the best interest of the DAF.
4.3.2. Upon entry to the Academy, the agreement the basic cadets must sign must also state if they are subsequently discharged, resign for the good of the service, or are not ordered to active duty due to their serious misconduct, they may be required to reimburse the United States for education costs commensurate with their time spent at the Academy.
In November 2021, a federal vaccine mandate for all military members was issued. Since then, the USAFA says they have not dismissed any cadets for refusing the get the vaccine. However, at this point, USAFA tells 13 Investigates consequences will be coming for those who continue their refusal.",en,Four U.S. Air Force Academy cadets denied graduation for refusing COVID-19 vaccine,CENTER,HIGH,HIGH CREDIBILITY,,

Three cadets at the U.S. Air Force Academy who have rejected the COVID-19 vaccine won’t be commissioned as military officers when they graduate, the academy said.
Academy spokesman Dean Miller said in a statement that the three seniors in question “will not be commissioned into the United States Air Force as long as they remain unvaccinated,” although they will graduate with bachelor’s degrees.
A fourth cadet, who was previously among those refusing to comply with the academy’s COVID-19 vaccine mandate, has since decided to take the shot in order to become an officer, Miller said.
The military academies typically require students to repay the cost of their education if they leave during their junior or senior year and don’t complete the program. The final decision is made by the secretary of each military branch.
The costs could be as much as $200,000, depending on the circumstances. In 2015, the U.S. Military Academy at West Point ordered a cadet to pay $226,662 in tuition costs after discharging him over multiple infractions, including smuggling alcohol.
The U.S. Air Force, which so far is the only military branch that blocks cadets from being commissioned as officers for refusing to get the COVID-19 vaccine, has yet to decide whether to require the unvaccinated trio to pay for their education, Miller said.
The announcement came days after Rep. Doug Lamborn (R-Colo.), whose congressional district covers Colorado Springs, wrote in protest of the possibility that the four cadets might not be allowed to graduate because of vaccine refusal.
“I was extremely disappointed to hear that the United States Air Force Academy is planning to deny these four cadets the opportunity to graduate and serve our nation because of their request to uphold their tightly held religious beliefs,” Lamborn wrote in a letter to the academy’s superintendent.
“America was founded on the principles of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, which encompasses protecting the religious rights of the individual. That includes those who put on the uniform and volunteer to serve our nation. It is imperative that our military leaders uphold the constitutional rights of these cadets.”
The Air Force’s graduation ceremony is scheduled for May 25. U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, who made COVID-19 vaccination mandatory for all military service members and academy students last year, will be featured as a keynote speaker.
“Mandatory vaccinations are familiar to all of our Service members, and mission-critical inoculation is almost as old as the U.S. military itself,” Austin said in August 2021 in a memo announcing the vaccine mandate.
As of April, about 3,400 troops had been involuntarily separated from service due to vaccination noncompliance, the Military Times reported.

nbcnews.com,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/4-air-force-academy-cadets-may-not-graduate-refusing-get-covid-vaccine-rcna28870,"WASHINGTON — Four cadets at the Air Force Academy may not graduate or be commissioned as military officers this month because they have refused the Covid-19 vaccine, and they may be required to pay back thousands of dollars in tuition costs, according to Air Force officials.
It’s the only military academy, so far, where cadets may face such penalties. The Army and Navy said that as of now, not one of their seniors is being prevented from graduating at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York, or the Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, due to vaccine refusals. The graduations are in about two weeks.
Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin last year made the Covid-19 vaccinations mandatory for service members, including those at the military academies, saying the vaccine is critical to maintaining military readiness and the health of the force.
Military leaders have argued that troops for decades have been required to get as many as 17 vaccines in order to maintain the health of the force, particularly those deploying overseas. Students arriving at the military academies get a regimen of shots on their first day — such as measles, mumps and rubella — if they aren’t already vaccinated. And they routinely get regular flu shots in the fall.
Members of Congress, the military and the public have questioned if the exemption reviews by the military services have been fair. There have been multiple lawsuits filed against the mandate, mainly centering on the fact that very few service members have been granted religious exemptions from the shots.
Until the Covid-19 vaccine, very few military members sought religious exemptions to any vaccines.
Lt. Col. Brian Maguire, an Air Force Academy spokesman, said that while vaccination status may hinder the graduation of the four seniors, “there are still two weeks until graduation, so their status could change as the cadets weigh their options.”
According to Maguire, the four cadets — who are not named — have been informed of the potential consequences, and have met with the academy’s superintendent. In addition to those four, there are two juniors, one sophomore and six freshmen at the academy who have also refused the vaccine.
The military academies for years have required students under certain circumstances to repay tuition costs if they leave during their junior or senior year. Often those involve students with disciplinary issues or similar problems. The costs can be as much as $200,000, or more, and any final decision on repayment is made by the service secretary.
West Point said that there are no members of the Class of 2022 who have refused to get the vaccine.
Across the military, the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps have discharged nearly 4,000 active duty service members for refusing the vaccine. According to recent data released by the services, more than 2,100 Marines, 900 sailors, 500 Army soldiers and 360 airmen have been thrown out of the military, and at least 50 were discharged during entry level training, before they moved into active duty service.
Those who flatly refuse the vaccine without seeking an exemption are still being discharged. But the courts have stalled additional discharges of service members who sought religious exemptions.
Last month, a federal judge in Texas barred the Navy from taking action for now against sailors who have objected to being vaccinated on religious grounds.
U.S. District Judge Reed O’Connor had, in January, issued a preliminary injunction preventing the Navy from disciplining or discharging 35 sailors who sued over the Navy’s vaccine policy while their case played out. In April, O’Connor agreed the case could go forward as a class action suit and issued a preliminary injunction covering about 4,000 sailors who have objected on religious grounds to being vaccinated.
Also last month, a federal judge in Ohio granted a preliminary injunction blocking the Air Force from disciplining a dozen officers and some additional airmen and reservists who were seeking religious exemptions. The officers, mostly from Wright-Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton, Ohio, sued in February after their exemption requests were denied.
According to the military, as many as 20,000 service members have asked for religious exemptions. Thousands have been denied.
As of recent data, the Air Force has approved 73 religious exemptions, the Marine Corps has approved seven, and the Army has approved eight. Before the injunction, the Navy conditionally approved one reservist and 26 active-duty requests for religious exemptions, and 10 requests from members of the Individual Ready Reserve. The IRR approvals mean that those sailors don’t have to be vaccinated until they are actually called to serve.

denverpost.com,https://www.denverpost.com/2022/05/21/air-force-cadets-refused-vaccine-commissioned/,"WASHINGTON — Three cadets at the U.S. Air Force Academy who have refused the COVID-19 vaccine will not be commissioned as military officers but will graduate with bachelor’s degrees, the academy said Saturday.
Academy spokesman Dean Miller said that a fourth cadet who had refused the vaccine until about a week ago, decided to be vaccinated and will graduate and become an Air Force officer.
In a statement, Miller said that while the three will get a degree “they will not be commissioned into the United States Air Force as long as they remain unvaccinated.” He added that a decision on whether to require the three to reimburse the United States for education costs in lieu of service will be made by the secretary of the Air Force.
As of Saturday, the Air Force is the only military academy, so far, where cadets are not being commissioned due to vaccine refusal. All of the more than 1,000 Army cadets at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York, graduated and were commissioned as officers earlier in the day and all were vaccinated.
The Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, said Saturday that none of the Navy or Marine Corps seniors there are being prevented from commissioning due to vaccine refusals. That graduation is later this week, and the Air Force ceremony is Wednesday in Colorado. Ahead of that ceremony, the U.S. Air Force Academy Board conducted its standard review of whether this year’s class had met all graduation requirements on Friday.
Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, who is the scheduled speaker at the Air Force graduation, last year made the COVID-19 vaccinations mandatory for service members, including those at the military academies, saying the vaccine is critical to maintaining military readiness and the health of the force.
Military leaders have argued that troops for decades have been required to get as many as 17 vaccines in order to maintain the health of the force, particularly those deploying overseas. Students arriving at the military academies get a regimen of shots on their first day — such as measles, mumps and rubella – if they aren’t already vaccinated. And they routinely get flu shots in the fall.
Members of Congress, the military, and the public have questioned if the exemption reviews by the military services have been fair. There have been multiple lawsuits filed against the mandate, mainly centering on the fact that very few service members have been granted religious exemptions from the shots.
Until the COVID-19 vaccine, very few military members sought religious exemptions to any vaccines.
Lt. Col. Brian Maguire, an Air Force Academy spokesman, said a week ago that all four of the cadets had been informed of the potential consequences and met with the academy’s superintendent. And he noted then that they still had time before graduation to change their minds – and one did.
The military academies for years have required students under certain circumstances to repay tuition costs if they leave during their junior or senior year. Often those cases involve students with disciplinary issues or similar problems. The costs can be as much as $200,000, or more, and any final decision on repayment is made by the service secretary.
