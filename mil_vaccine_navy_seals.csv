Liberty Counsel has filed a declaration in Navy SEAL 1 v. Austin (formerly Biden) in support of the request for federal Judge Steven Merryday to issue a preliminary injunction for the remaining 28 plaintiffs in the case and to certify the entire class of the military and provide relief from the unlawful shot mandates. 

Liberty Counsel represents plaintiffs from all branches of the military who were denied religious exemptions from the COVID shot mandate. One of the remaining 28 plaintiffs who were not part of last week’s preliminary injunction is a Lt. Colonel in the Air Force who will be placed on the Officer’s Disciplinary Notebook, which is the beginning of the end of his career. 

In addition to the plaintiffs in the case, as of February 22, 2022, Liberty Counsel has been providing legal assistance to more than 700 servicemembers from the Army, Air Force, Space Force, Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard. Liberty Counsel maintains an internal “Servicemember Final Denial List” for servicemembers who have contacted Liberty Counsel and whose final Religious Accommodation appeals have been denied. As of February 9, the list includes 131 military members, including 116 whose final denials were issued more than five business days ago. Before servicemembers receive final denials, many are required to vacate on-base housing and their families are left homeless. These families also are being forced to pay out-of-pocket to live in hotel rooms or travel trailers. Members on overseas deployments have been told they will not be granted terminal leave to return from overseas, pack down their on-base housing, transition to the civilian sector, find employment, and receive pay while doing so. Instead, they are given only four days of leave to complete all that. 

In addition, based on the “Servicemember Final Denial List” alone, the U.S. military will continue to lose highly qualified and experienced personnel, including diverse fields and specialties as artillery, aviation safety, air support control, administration, boatswains’ mate, chaplain, civil affairs, corpsman, crew chief, culinary specialist, cyber warfare operations, damage control, electronic warfare, emergency management, engineering, explosive ordnance disposal, flight nurse, imagery analyst, infantry officer, in-flight refueling, intelligence, logistics, marine science, medical, munitions inspection, nuclear propulsion, operations specialist, space operations officer, recruiter, security forces officer, SERE specialist, and special agent.

Last week, Judge Merryday granted a preliminary injunction for two service members in Navy SEAL 1 v. Austin who were denied religious exemptions from the COVID shot mandate. The court based its ruling on the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), finding that the Marines and the Navy failed to demonstrate “to the individualized person” two of RFRA’s essential requirements on government action that burdens a person’s sincere religious belief – a compelling interest and the least restrictive means. This conclusion alone will essentially undo the blanket requirement placed on service members to get the COVID shots when such action burdens their sincere religious beliefs. 

The court further wrote, “In sum, the defendants fail to articulate why Navy Commander’s and Lieutenant Colonel 2’s sincerely held religious practice must yield to the requirement to accept COVID-19 vaccination…The submission reveals a process of ‘rubber stamp’ adjudication by form letter, a process incompatible with RFRA’s command to assess each request ‘to the person.’…A blanket or categorical grant no more satisfies RFRA’s individualized assessment than does a blanket or categorical denial. Although only a sample of the hundreds of denial letters issued by the military, the documents considered in conjunction with the administrative record supporting Navy Commander’s and Lieutenant Colonel 2’s denial, strongly illustrates that the military fails to afford an applicant an actual ‘case-by-case assessment’ as required by RFRA…Requiring a service member either to follow a direct order contrary to a sincerely held religious belief or to face immediate processing for separation or other punishment undoubtedly causes irreparable harm,” wrote the court. 

Liberty Counsel Founder and Chairman Mat Staver said, “Tragically, the number of servicemembers who have sought assistance from Liberty Counsel pales in comparison to the pool of those who need relief from the unconstitutional shot mandates. With more than 24,000 servicemembers expecting denials of their religious accommodations, every service member deserves protection from this unlawful abuse.”

Court Urged to Grant Military Class Action Relief

4010,dailymail.co.uk,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10567305/Federal-appeals-court-sides-Navy-SEALs-suing-Pentagons-vaccine-mandate.html,"A federal appeals court delivered a blow to Pentagon's vaccine mandate and denied the Biden Administration's attempt to reinstate the U.S. Navy's COVID-19 vaccine requirement.
On Monday the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals denied the Navy's request to reinstate the U.S. Navy's COVID-19 vaccine requirement a month after a federal judge in Fort Worth halted the mandate.
'[Evidence] suggests that the Navy has effectively stacked the deck against even those exemptions supported by Plaintiffs' immediate commanding officers and military chaplains,' the three-judge panel said.
While the percentage of vaccinated active duty personnel in each service is at 95 percent or higher, the number of unvaccinated personnel is close to 30,000
More than 1.62 million US military service members are vaccinated, according to the DoD
In November, dozens of U.S. Navy SEALs claimed they were wrongfully denied COVID vaccination exemptions on religious grounds, and that the Defense Department's mandate violates their First Amendment rights.
The troops sued the Department of Defense - along with President Joe Biden and top military officials.
The suit, which lists 35 unnamed service members, argues that the Pentagon is overstepping its bounds as a federal body and is infringing upon their constitutional rights, with the Navy requiring them to be fully vaccinated by November 28 - after they have been denied a religious exemption.
In some cases, the lawsuit argues, SEALs are reportedly being threatened and, in a few instances, harassed into complying with the demand - and have also been flat-out denied a religious exemption.
According to the filing, the SEALs behind the suit are all Christian and are pushing back against the mandate because it contradicts 'their sincerely held religious beliefs.'
The plaintiffs include members of the Navy SEALs and the Navy Special Warfare Combatant Craft Crewmen, a US Navy Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technician and US Navy Divers, according to court documents.
They filed their lawsuit with the help of the First Liberty Institute, a Texas-based Christian legal group that regularly takes on religious liberty cases.
The Navy itself has previously said that it has not granted an exemption to any vaccine in the past seven years
The Army, the US military's largest service with 478,000 active duty soldiers, reported the lowest number of service members seeking a religious exemption - just over 1,700 soldiers - compared with the other three smaller services
'Events around the world remind us daily that there are those who seek to harm America. Our military should be welcoming service members, not forcing them out because of their religious beliefs,' Mike Berry, director of military affairs for First Liberty Institute, said in a statement following Monday's ruling.
'The purge of religious servicemembers is not just devastating to morale, but it harms America's national security,' Berry added. 'It's time for our military to honor its constitutional obligations and grant religious accommodations for service members with sincere religious objections to the vaccine. We're grateful the Fifth Circuit denied the Navy's motion.'

Each military branch set its own deadline after Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin issued a memo in August requiring all service members to be vaccinated.
While the percentage of vaccinated active duty personnel in each service is at 95 percent or higher, the number of unvaccinated personnel is close to 30,000.
The Army, the US military's largest service with 478,000 active duty soldiers, reported the lowest number of service members seeking a religious exemption - just over 1,700 soldiers - compared with the other three smaller services.
In comparison, there are more than 4,700 in the Air Force, 3,000 in the Marine Corps and 2,700 in the Navy who are requesting the rarely given religious exemptions, according to data released by the branches in the past week.
None of the requests have yet to be approved.
On December 16, the Marines announced they had fired 103 service members for not getting vaccinated. The Army said it fired six people, including two commanding officers.
In January, US District Judge Reed O'Connor of the Northern District of Texas issued a preliminary injunction in the suit saying there is 'no COVID-19 exception to the First Amendment' and that the pandemic doesn't give the government the license to 'abrogate those freedoms.'
O'Connor sided with the troops, pointing out that 29 of the 35 service members had their requests for religious exemptions denied, calling the process of obtaining one 'theater.'
The Navy itself has previously said that it has not granted an exemption to any vaccine in the past seven years.
'Religious exemptions to the vaccine requirement are virtually non-existent. In the past seven years, the Navy has not granted a religious exemption to any vaccine requirement,' O'Connor wrote.
The first firings from the military's COVID-19 mandate began in December.
The Marines fired 103 members and the Army fired six, including two commanding officers.
The two Army officers commanded active-duty battalions.
Navy Cmdr. Lucian Kins, the executive officer of the destroyer USS Winston S. Churchill, became the first naval officer to be fired over vaccine refusal in December.
He reportedly requested a religious exemption to the military's vaccine requirement, but was denied and appealed the decision.
Navy spokesman Lt. Cmdr. Jason Fischer declined to give the precise reason why Kins was relieved of command, citing privacy concerns.
He did, however, state the reason for the firing was that Anderson lost confidence in Kins' ability to perform his duties after he failed to obey a lawful order.",en,Federal appeals court sides with Navy SEALs suing over Pentagon's vaccine mandate,RIGHT,LOW,LOW CREDIBILITY,,TRUE
2499,americanmilitarynews.com,https://americanmilitarynews.com/2022/03/vaccine-mandate-for-navy-seals-to-remain-blocked-us-court-of-appeals-rules/,"A federal appeals court denied the Biden administration’s attempt to reinstate the U.S. Navy’s COVID-19 vaccine requirement Monday, more than a month after a federal judge in Fort Worth initially halted the mandate.
The mandate, which required all active-duty Navy service members to be fully vaccinated by Nov. 28, is being challenged by a group of U.S. Navy SEALs and other Naval special warfare personnel. The group says the mandate violates their religious freedom and that they have unjustly been denied religious exemptions from receiving the vaccine.
Their lawsuit is against President Joe Biden, the Department of Defense, the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of the Navy.
In early January, U.S. District Judge Reed O’Connor of the Northern District of Texas signed a preliminary injunction blocking the mandate while the case reaches a final judgment.
On Monday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit denied the Department of Defense’s emergency stay request, which would have allowed the mandate to go into effect as the case goes through courts.
“[Evidence] suggests that the Navy has effectively stacked the deck against even those exemptions supported by Plaintiffs’ immediate commanding officers and military chaplains,” the three-judge panel said.

Thirty-five Navy Special Warfare service members sued President Joe Biden in November 2021 stating that his directive for them to get vaccinated or face possible court martial or involuntary separation violates their First Amendment right to religious liberty and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (1993).
Texas-based judge Reed O’Connor noted in his order that RFRA specifically provides the, “Government may substantially burden a person’s exercise of religion only if it demonstrates that application of the burden to the person—(1) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest; and (2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.”
O’Connor, an appointee of former President George W. Bush, determined that the vaccine mandate substantially burdens the SEALs religious beliefs and the government has not shown requiring them to be vaccinated is the least restrictive means for furthering its interest of a healthy fighting force.
“By all accounts, Plaintiffs have safely carried out their jobs during the pandemic. Prior to the vaccine mandate, at least six Plaintiffs conducted large-scale trainings and led courses without incident,” he wrote.

Reed highlighted that the Navy has granted exemptions for non-religious reasons, such as allergies or those participating in other clinical trials, and still allowed the sailors to deploy.
The 35 SEALs who have requested religious exemptions have cited their opposition to the use of aborted fetal cell lines in the development or manufacturing of the vaccines and their belief that “modifying one’s body is an afront to the Creator,” among other issues.
“The Navy servicemembers in this case seek to vindicate the very freedoms they have sacrificed so much to protect,” O’Connor wrote in his order.
“The COVID-19 pandemic provides the government no license to abrogate those freedoms. There is no COVID-19 exception to the First Amendment. There is no military exclusion from our Constitution.”

1773,washingtonexaminer.com,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/federal-judge-blocks-dod-navy-seal-vaccine-mandate,"A federal judge barred the Department of Defense from punishing a group of Navy SEALs for refusing to get vaccinated on religious grounds.
District Judge Reed O'Connor granted a preliminary injunction on Monday in response to a lawsuit filed for 35 unnamed Navy SEALs who had sued the Biden administration in November, alleging they had received several disciplinary measures for seeking a religious exemption.
""The Navy service members, in this case, seek to vindicate the very freedoms they have sacrificed so much to protect,"" O'Connor wrote in a filing on Monday. ""The COVID-19 pandemic provides the government no license to abrogate those freedoms. There is no COVID-19 exception to the First Amendment. There is no military exclusion from our Constitution.""
At the heart of the lawsuit is Secretary Lloyd Austin's vaccination mandate for the coronavirus, and whether he has the authority to issue the order. He gave each branch the power to come up with their own policy surrounding the vaccine.
The SEALs allege that they faced a range of disciplinary measures, including being administratively separated from vaccinated colleagues or dismissed, the initial lawsuit claims.
ERRANT DRONE STRIKES RAISE QUESTIONS ABOUT SAFEGUARDS TO PREVENT CIVILIAN CASUALTIES
The SEALs expressed opposition to the vaccines based on the sincerely held belief that aborted fetal cells were used to develop the vaccine, the belief that ""modifying one's body is an affront to the Creator,"" and ""direct, divine instruction not to receive the vaccine,"" the ruling states.
Fetal cell lines are used in the development of vaccines, but the cells typically used are from an aborted fetus three decades ago, experts report. They're also the same cell lines used in the development of many common drugs, including aspirin and ibuprofen.
Of the 35 named in the suit, 19 had filed requests for a religious exemption, only to have it denied by the Navy, the federal judge wrote.
""The Navy has not granted a religious exemption to any vaccine in recent memory,"" O'Connor wrote. ""It merely rubber stamps each denial.""
As of Dec. 17, the military has not approved a single religious exemption to the COVID-19 vaccine, even as more than 12,000 service members sought one. Each service branch is overwhelmingly vaccinated and those who have refused remain a tiny percentage, though the number is in the thousands given the sheer size of the military. The branches have already begun discharging those who have failed to comply with the order and have either not applied for or been denied an exemption.
O'Connor also argued that the threat of spreading COVID-19 among the Navy's sailors is not sufficient to justify denying the sailors their First Amendment rights.
""The Plaintiffs' loss of religious liberties outweighs any forthcoming harm to the Navy. Even the direst circumstances cannot justify the loss of constitutional rights. Fortunately, the future does not look so dire. Nearly 100% of the Navy has been vaccinated,"" O'Connor wrote.
Dozens of Republican lawmakers filed an amicus brief in support of the SEALs last month while the America First Policy Institute, a policy group backed by former President Donald Trump, did in November.
First Liberty Institute, the religious freedom legal organization representing the 35 SEALs in the Northern District of Texas, declared the ruling a victory.

Filed in November by First Liberty Institute on behalf of 35 Navy SEALs and three reservists, the lawsuit sought a religious exemption from the Biden administration’s Department of Defense vaccine mandate as thousands of U.S. military members face possible discharge for not complying. In the decision, Judge Reed O’Connor, U.S. District Court Judge for the Northern District of Texas, ruled that the coronavirus pandemic “provides the government no license to abrogate” the First Amendment rights of America’s servicemen and women.
“Our nation asks the men and women in our military to serve, suffer, and sacrifice. But we do not ask them to lay aside their citizenry and give up the very rights they have sworn to protect,” the judge wrote.
Members of the U.S. military are expressing their grave concerns as the Pentagon issues a coronavirus vaccine mandate. https://t.co/Vvc3xQV3j8 — Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) August 29, 2021
While the judge acknowledged that the military provides members a pathway to a religious exemption for vaccines, he dismissed this as mere “theater,” noting that no serious weight or attention is given to religious exemptions as they are to secular exemptions, such as potential allergic reactions.
The mandate treats comparable secular activity (e.g., medical exemptions) more favorably than religious activity. First, the Navy has granted only secular exemptions—it has never granted a religious exemption from the vaccine. Second, even if the Navy were to grant a religious exemption, that exemption would still receive less favorable treatment than its secular counterparts. Those who receive religious exemptions are medically disqualified. Those who receive medical exemptions are not. But the activity itself—forgoing the vaccine—is identical. Given the irrationality of the mandate, “[i]t is unsurprising that such litigants are entitled to relief.”
Describing the pathway to religious exemption as a “fifty–step process to adjudicate religious accommodation requests,” the judge argued that requests are essentially denied before “the moment they begin.”
The first fifteen steps require an administrator to update a prepared disapproval template with the requester’s name and rank. In essence, the Plaintiffs’ requests are denied the moment they begin. That prepared letter is then sent to seven offices for review. After those offices review the disapproval letter, the administrator packages the letter with other religious accommodation requests for final signature. The administrator then prepares an internal memo to Vice Admiral John Nowell, asking him to “sign . . . letters disapproving immunization waiver requests based on sincerely held religious beliefs.” Then, at step thirty-five of the process, the administrator is told—for the first time—to read through the religious accommodation request. At that point, the disapproval letter has already been written, the religious accommodation request and related documents has already been reviewed by several offices, the disapproval has already been packaged with similar requests, and an internal memo has already been drafted requesting that Vice Admiral Nowell disapprove the religious accommodation request.
Acknowledging the bias against religious freedoms, the judge determined that the Biden administration failed to show a compelling interest in forcing service members to violate their “sincerely held religious beliefs” in accordance with the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA).
“Without individualized assessment, the Navy cannot demonstrate a compelling interest in vaccinating these particular Plaintiffs,” the judge argued. “Even if Defendants have a broad compelling interest in widespread vaccination of its force, they have achieved this goal without the participation of the thirty-five Plaintiffs here.”
“Several Plaintiffs have tested positive for antibodies, showing the presence of natural immunity. With a 99.4% vaccination rate, the Navy’s herd immunity is at an all-time high,” he continued. “COVID-19 treatments are becoming increasingly effective at reducing hospitalization and death.”
The case is U.S. NAVY Seals 1-26 v. Biden, No. 4:21-cv-1236 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas.

U.S. District Court Judge Reed O'Connor, with the Northern District of Texas in Fort Worth, ruled Monday that the DoD has violated the sailors' constitutional right to refuse the vaccine based on their religious beliefs.
According to the order from Reed, ""there is no military exclusion from our Constitution.""

""The COVID-19 pandemic provides the government no license to abrogate those freedoms. There is no COVID-19 exception to the First Amendment,"" O'Connor wrote in a 26-page order.
The 35 sailors are not named in the lawsuit, citing privacy and a threat to national and operational security. They include 26 enlisted or chief warrant Navy Sea, Air and Land, or SEAL, members, five enlisted special warfare combatant craft crew members, three enlisted Navy divers and an enlisted explosive ordnance disposal technician.
The plaintiffs objected to any vaccines that were developed from aborted fetal cell lines or that ""modified"" their bodies -- ""an affront to the Creator,"" they wrote in their suit filed in November.
While the vaccines were developed with cell lines descended from fetuses aborted in the 1970s and 1980s, they contain no aborted fetal tissue.
The plaintiffs also argued they have received ""direct, divine instruction not to receive the vaccine"" and oppose ""injecting trace amounts of animal cells into one's body.""
While the majority of the plaintiffs did not address the fact that the Pentagon requires service members to receive numerous vaccines, including the anthrax vaccine for special operators in some environments, one sailor said he experienced negative side effects from a previous vaccination and ""came to regret"" it, seeing vaccines as a ""defilement of his body.""
""Through prayer and reflection, this plaintiff has determined that receiving a COVID-19 vaccine similarly would defile his body,"" according to the lawsuit.
In the complaint, plaintiffs attorneys also cited a Military.com report on a rare side effect of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine -- heart inflammation known as myocarditis and pericarditis -- as a reason for their clients not wanting the vaccine.
The complication also can occur as the result of a COVID-19 infection.
While acknowledging that COVID-19 has killed more than 80 service members since the beginning of the pandemic, O'Connor said the court ""does not make light of COVID-19's impact on the military.""
But, he said, the Navy's religious exemption process has been ""theatre"" to date, noting that no exemptions have been granted.
""The facts overwhelmingly indicate that the Navy will deny the religious accommodations,"" O'Connor wrote. ""The Navy has, to date, never granted a religious accommodation request for the COVID-19 vaccine. In fact, in the past seven years, the Navy has never granted a single religious exemption for any vaccine.""
The sailors, who hail from Catholic, Eastern Orthodox and Protestant Christian backgrounds, filed their lawsuit through the First Liberty Institute, a nonprofit that serves to defend religious freedom.
Their attorney, Michael Berry, is a former Marine Corps judge advocate general who deployed to Afghanistan in 2008 and continues to serve in the Marine Corps Reserve, according to the institute's website.
""Forcing a service member to choose between their faith and serving their country is abhorrent to the Constitution and America's values,"" Berry said in a statement released Monday. ""Punishing SEALs for simply asking for a religious accommodation is purely vindictive and punitive.""
No major religions oppose COVID-19 vaccinations, including the Roman Catholic Church, whose leader, Pope Francis, has called receiving it an ""act of love"" that is consistent with the faith.
Leaders of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America said in September ""there is no exemption in the Orthodox Church for Her faithful from any vaccination for religious reasons.""
And leaders in the Baptist faith, the largest Protestant denomination in the U.S., have said they support vaccination but oppose mandates. Danny Akin, president of the Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary, told the Baptist Press in September that he believes ""getting vaccinated is in the best interest of national health.""
""However, an emergency mandate through regulatory action by the Department of Labor is the government trespassing on civil liberties,"" Akin said, referring to President Joe Biden's mandate for federal workers, contractors and private employers.
The lawsuit is one of several filed that have been filed against Biden, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro and the Defense Department seeking to halt the vaccine mandate, which was ordered by Austin in August.
More than 1.9 million U.S. service members, including members of the Reserve and National Guard, have received vaccines for COVID-19. At least 96% of the active-duty Navy, Army and Air Force were fully vaccinated by their services' respective deadlines. As of Dec. 22, 95% of active-duty Marines had received at least one dose.
The services have processes for requesting medical and religious exemptions. To date, a few hundred have received medical exemptions, mainly with the recommendations of a physician, and no religious exemptions have been approved.
The Air Force began discharging personnel after its Nov. 2 deadline passed, with 27 airmen dismissed the week of the deadline. The Marine Corps has separated 206 Marines for refusing the vaccine.
There have been 261,504 cases of COVID-19 among U.S. service members since the beginning of the pandemic in February 2020 and 82 deaths.
During a press conference at the Pentagon on Tuesday, spokesman John Kirby said he could not comment specifically on the order, given that it is part of ongoing litigation.
""We are aware, of course, and we are reviewing it and discussing it with the Department of Justice to determine what options are available to us going forward,"" Kirby said.
O'Connor was nominated to the federal bench in June 2007 by President George W. Bush. He has a history of rulings against Democratic policies and mandates, the most notable occurring in late 2018 when he declared the Affordable Care Act unconstitutional.
That ruling was upheld by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit but was reversed by the U.S. Supreme Court in a 7-2 decision, dissented only by Associate Justices Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch.

2668,americanmilitarynews.com,https://americanmilitarynews.com/2022/03/navy-seals-ask-supreme-court-to-intervene-in-covid-vaccine-mandate-battle/,"A group of U.S. Navy SEALs and other Naval Special Warfare service members are asking the U.S. Supreme Court to uphold an injunction that temporarily blocks the U.S. Navy from enforcing the COVID-19 vaccine mandate.
The group of 35 Navy plaintiffs includes 26 Navy SEALs, multiple Special Warfare Combatant Craft Crewmen (SWCC) and Navy Divers, and an Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Technician and is being represented by the First Liberty Institute. The plaintiffs initially sued the Navy for not granting religious accommodations to the military-wide vaccine mandate.
Judge Reed O’Connor, of the U.S. District Court Texas’ Northern District, first granted an injunction for the group of plaintiffs in January. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals has since upheld the injunction. Last week, President Joe Biden’s administration brought the issue before the Supreme Court, asking for it to overturn the injunction, arguing O’Connor’s ruling “usurps the Navy’s authority to decide which servicemembers should be deployed to execute some of the military’s most sensitive and dangerous missions.”
On Monday, the group of Navy plaintiffs responded to the Biden administration’s filing.
“The preliminary injunction at issue does not require the Navy1 to deploy any of the thirty–five plaintiffs—U.S. Navy SEALs and Naval Special Warfare personnel honorably serving our country. Both the district court and the Fifth Circuit confirmed that,” the filing begins. “The injunction merely preserves the status quo while this case is litigated. Far from supplanting military judgment, the injunction retains the judgments the Navy already made in terms of plaintiffs’ jobs, pay, and training.”
The plaintiffs further note that the Navy remains opposed to their requests for religious exemptions to the vaccine despite having already granted non-religious exemptions.
“Despite over 99% of the Navy being vaccinated, the Navy has not granted a single religious exemption for the COVID-19 vaccination to any active or reserve duty servicemember while granting hundreds of exemptions for secular reasons, including to other members of Naval Special
Warfare,” the response filing reads.
Indeed, as of Wednesday, the Navy had approved 12 permanent medical exemptions to the COVID-19 vaccine mandate, 212 temporary medical exemptions and 26 more administrative exemptions.
The Navy plaintiffs argued, “servicemembers or contractors unvaccinated for secular reasons—whether temporarily so or not—present the same risk as plaintiffs who are unvaccinated for religious reasons.”
As of last week, all other U.S. military have granted at least one religious accommodation to the vaccine mandate. The U.S. Marine Corps was the first U.S. military branch to approve any religious exemption and, as of last week, has approved six such religious exemptions. The U.S. Air Force was the second U.S. military branch to approve any religious exemptions and now leads on that front with 19 approved religious exemptions as of Tuesday. Last week, the U.S. Army became the third service branch to approve a religious accommodation for an active service member.
The U.S. Navy has technically approved a religious accommodation to its COVID-19 vaccine mandate, but that accommodation is only for a member of the Individual Ready Reserve (IRR). The accommodation is also conditional and would cease to exempt the service member from the vaccine mandate if they were ever called up to a more active military component.
Calling up the IRR to active service technically requires a president to make an emergency declaration, in line with 10 U.S. Code § 12302. President Donald Trump issued such a declaration in March 2020, known as Executive Order 13912. EO 13912 authorized the military to call on Selected Reserve and certain IRR members to assist in the military’s COVID-19 response.
The Navy plaintiffs have argued that the Navy’s comparative lack of religious accommodations for the vaccine mandate is evidence of the service “rubber stamping” denials without regard for individual circumstances.",en,Navy SEALs ask Supreme Court to intervene in COVID vaccine mandate battle,RIGHT-CENTER,MOSTLY FACTUAL,HIGH CREDIBILITY,,
3940,sandiegouniontribune.com,https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/military/story/2022-01-03/navy-religious-vaccine-waivers,"A Texas U.S. District Court judge issued a temporary injunction Monday in one of the ongoing federal lawsuits brought by service members challenging the Pentagon’s coronavirus vaccine mandate, preventing the service from disciplining 35 sailors for refusing the vaccine.
The case, brought by religious-liberty focused law firm the First Liberty Institute, includes 35 Naval Special Warfare sailors, several of whom are based in Southern California. San Diego is home to the Naval Special Warfare Command, including several Navy SEAL teams, special warfare combatant-craft crewmen and explosive ordnance disposal technicians.
Mike Berry, general counsel for the First Liberty Institute, lauded the injunction in an emailed statement Monday.

“Forcing a service member to choose between their faith and serving their country is abhorrent to the Constitution and America’s values,” Berry said. “Punishing SEALs for simply asking for a religious accommodation is purely vindictive and punitive. We’re pleased that the court has acted to protect our brave warriors before more damage is done to our national security.”
The order prevents the Navy from applying its vaccine mandate and administrative discharge policy on the 35 sailors involved in the lawsuit. All active-duty service members are required to be fully-vaccinated against COVID-19. Those who refused the vaccine face punishment including discharge from the military.
A Navy spokesperson, citing ongoing litigation, declined to comment on the ruling. It is unclear whether it will have any effect on other sailors facing separation.
As of Thursday, the Marine Corps had already booted 206 Marines for refusing the vaccine. The Navy is expected to begin doing the same, according to a Dec. 15 administrative message.
Both the Navy and Marine Corps received thousands of religious, medical and administrative waiver requests for the coronavirus vaccine. While the services approved both medical and administrative waivers, neither approved any of the religious requests.
The judge, Reed O’Connor, said in his order that the Navy’s blanket denial of all religious waiver requests amounted to a violation of their rights under the First Amendment and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.
“The Navy servicemembers in this case seek to vindicate the very freedoms they have sacrificed so much to protect,” O’Connor wrote in the ruling. “The COVID-19 pandemic provides the government no license to abrogate those freedoms. There is no COVID-19 exception to the First Amendment. There is no military exclusion from our Constitution.”
O’Connor goes on to write that the claims of the 35 sailors are “strong,” noting that “secular” waivers, in the guise of medical waivers, were approved while religious ones were not.
“As a brief preview, the vaccine mandate fails strict scrutiny,” the judge wrote. “The mandate treats comparable secular activity (e.g., medical exemptions) more favorably than religious activity.”
The judge goes on to say that the loss of the sailors’ “religious liberties outweighs any forthcoming harm to the Navy,” and that although 80 service members have died from the virus, 99 percent of the Navy is vaccinated and that “COVID-19 treatments are becoming more effective and widely available.”
O’Connor, who was appointed in 2007 by then-President George W. Bush, made news as the state government of Texas challenged Obama administration policies in court, striking several down. According to the Texas Tribune, that was no accident, as the state repeatedly filed cases in O’Connor’s district.
Notably, O’Connor struck down the entirety of the Affordable Care Act in 2018 after Texas and several Republican-led states sued. That ruling was overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court in June.",en,Judge says Navy violates rights of SEALs in denying religious waivers on vaccines,CENTER,,,,
1634,yellowhammernews.com,https://yellowhammernews.com/ag-joins-seals-v-biden-religious-liberty-battle-over-vaccine-edict/,"Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall announced Monday he had filed an amicus brief to a lawsuit on behalf of U.S. military personnel against the Biden administration’s COVID-19 vaccine mandate.
The U.S. Navy SEALs v. Biden lawsuit features 35 Navy service members, who are assigned to Naval Special Warfare Command Units, challenging the administration’s vaccine decree on the basis of First Amendment protections.
The plaintiffs, who were not granted a religious exemption from the edict, are asserting their rights under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act and the First Amendment’s free exercise clause.
In a statement announcing the brief’s filing, Marshall railed against the progressive administration’s “heavy-handed approach” to its mass vaccination campaign.
“Perhaps more than any other of President Biden’s vaccine mandates, his heavy-handed approach has been most profoundly felt by the U.S. military,” said Marshall in a release. “Just over a year ago, military personal were ordered to begin taking COVID-19 vaccinations and many who asserted religious objections to the vaccine were summarily denied. Records indicate that while more than 4,000 Naval active duty and reserve sailors submitted requests for religious accommodations, all but a few dozen had their requests denied.”
According to Alabama’s chief law enforcement officer, service members are entitled to religious exemptions from forced vaccination.
“Many thousands in uniform are being denied their constitutional rights by the Biden administration’s blanket refusal to grant their wishes for religious exemption from the military’s COVID-19 vaccine mandate,” he said. “U.S. military personnel deserve and are indeed entitled to the same First Amendment protections of their religious liberties as any other American citizen.”
Marshall joined state attorneys general from Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia and Wyoming in filing the brief before the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.

4679,washingtontimes.com,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2022/mar/14/navy-seals-ask-supreme-court-end-vaccine-exemption/,"Attorneys for 35 Navy SEALs and other special warfare personnel asked the Supreme Court on Monday to reject a Biden administration emergency motion seeking a stay of a preliminary injunction protecting the warriors from punishment for objecting to the Defense Department’s vaccine mandate on religious grounds.
The move comes one week after the administration asked the high court to lift an injunction keeping the Navy from considering vaccination status when deploying service members.
“[T]he Navy has not granted a single request for religious accommodation for any servicemember, though it has granted hundreds of non-religious exemptions. While judges should not presume to run the military, neither may courts turn a blind eye to violations of the Constitution or the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA),” the attorneys wrote in a court filing. “Allowing blind deference to military preferences, as the Navy urges, would rewrite RFRA. Only Congress may do that.”
Only a handful of service members across the military’s branches have received religious exemptions to vaccine mandates, despite various laws and regulations requiring religious accommodation, advocates say.
The matter is before associate Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., who had set Monday as the deadline for a response from the military personnel’s attorneys. Justice Alito can either decide the matter on his own or refer it to the full court.
In January, Judge Reed O’Connor of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas blocked the Navy from taking action against the SEALs and other special operations personnel.
“The Navy servicemembers in this case seek to vindicate the very freedoms they have sacrificed so much to protect. The COVID-19 pandemic provides the government no license to abrogate those freedoms. There is no COVID-19 exception to the First Amendment. There is no military exclusion from our Constitution,” Judge O’Connor wrote at the time.
A Defense Department spokesman referred questions to the Justice Department “as the matter involves litigation.” The Navy also deferred to the DOJ, but a spokeswoman for that agency said it would decline “to comment outside of our filings in this case.”
Mike Berry is an attorney for First Liberty Institute, which is representing the service members.
“Our clients are willing to make tremendous sacrifices to protect their fellow warriors and our freedoms,” Mr. Berry said in a statement. “Our hope is that the Supreme Court will reject this punitive action by the Biden administration and respect the religious liberty of our clients. No member of the military should be forced to sacrifice the very rights they fight to protect to be able to serve.”

Collier, No. 21-5592, 595 U.S. _____ (2022), attached hereto as Exhibit A, issued March 24, 2022. In Ramirez, the Supreme Court – when reviewing the appropriate standards under a preliminary injunction – held as follows: (1) RLUIPA (and its “sister statute” RFRA) show that “the government cannot discharge [its] burden by pointing to broadly formulated interests.” (Slip Op. at 12 (quoting Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 573 U.S. 682, 726 (2014))). Ramirez confirms this Court’s holding (Doc. 111 at 34-35) that the government cannot discharge its burden by formulating its interest in an overly broad manner, and Defendants have failed to satisfy their burden under RFRA by predicating their denial of Plaintiffs’ requested religious accommodations on “broadly articulated interests in Case 8:21-cv-02429-SDM-TGW Document 143 Filed 03/24/22 Page 2 of 4 PageID 9335 ‘the health and safety of the force’ and on the assertion that broadly articulated ‘demands of military life’ render ineffective any less restrictive means.” (Doc. 111 at 38.) (2) RLUIPA (and its “sister statute” RFRA) require an individualized assessment that applies the challenged law to the particular person. (See Slip Op. at 12 (government must “demonstrate that the compelling interest test is satisfied through application of the challenged law [to] the particular claimant whose sincere exercise of religion is being substantially burdened.” (quoting Holt v. Hobbs, 574 U. S. 352, 363 (2015))); (Slip Op. at 15 (noting that “speculation is insufficient to satisfy respondents’ burden [under strict scrutiny] and fails to engage in the sort of case-by-case analysis that RLUIPA requires.” (emphasis added)).) Ramirez again confirms the correctness of this Court’s holding that Defendants have failed to engage in the “to the person evaluation required by RFRA.” (Doc. 111 at 40.) (3) A “categorical ban” can hardly be the least restrictive means when other alternatives are available. (Slip Op. at 14 (“But respondents fail to show that a categorical ban on all audible prayer is the least restrictive means of furthering their compelling interests.”)); Slip Op. at 16 (“respondents have not shown that a total ban on audible prayer is the least restrictive means of furthering their asserted interests”)).).) Yet again, Ramirez confirms that this Court is correct in its holding that Defendants’ “blanket or categorical ban [cannot] satisfy[y] RFRA’s individualized assessment.” (Doc. 111 at 44.) 2 Case 8:21-cv-02429-SDM-TGW Document 143 Filed 03/24/22 Page 3 of 4 PageID 9336 (4) A “conclusory defense” of the challenged policy’s tailoring is insufficient under strict scrutiny, and the Court will not simply “defer” to the government’s determination. (Slip Op. at 14 (“Instead, respondents offer only a conclusory defense of the policy’s tailoring. . . . They ask that we simply defer to their determination. This is not enough under RLUIPA.” (emphasis added)).) Ramirez proves that this Court’s refusal to grant blind deference to the military in the face of the demands of RFRA is correct as a matter of law. (Doc. 111 at 30 (“But that deference does not justify the abdication of the responsibility, conferred by Congress, to apply [a statute’s] rigorous standard.”).) (5) Government fails strict scrutiny when its asserted interest “is one reasonably addressed by means short of banning all touch.” (Slip Op. at 17 (italics original).)Ramirez thus evinces the astuteness of this Court in finding that a categorical ban simply fails the least restrictive means test when other available alternatives were “successfully implemented for more than a year before the development of the vaccines and have continued to implement in conjunction with vaccines.” (Doc. 111 at 41.) 3 Case 8:21-cv-02429-SDM-TGW Document 143 Filed 03/24/22 Page 4 of 4 PageID 9337 /s/ Daniel J.

The Biden administration filed an emergency application with the Supreme Court on Monday, asking it to freeze a lower-court opinion requiring the Navy to deploy special operations forces even though they have refused to get vaccinated for Covid-19.
“This application seeks relief from a preliminary injunction that usurps the Navy’s authority to decide which servicemembers should be deployed to execute some of the military’s most sensitive and dangerous missions,” Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar told the justices in the administration’s application on Monday.
She is not challenging a portion of the injunction that protected the SEALs and other personnel from discipline or discharge for remaining unvaccinated. But she is asking that the ruling forcing the Navy to assign and deploy 35 unvaccinated members of special operations forces be blocked while the appeals process plays out.
The challengers – including more than two dozen Navy SEALs – say they have religious objections to the requirement and are seeking an exemption.
A district court ruled against the administration, and a federal appeals court declined to step in, saying that it had not demonstrated “paramount interests” that justify vaccinating the plaintiffs in violation of their religious beliefs.
Lawyers for the First Liberty Institute are representing the challengers and said in a statement on Monday that the lower courts “got it right.”
“The U.S. Supreme Court should reject this latest attempt to punish our clients and make clear, once and for all, that our service members do not forfeit their religious freedom because they are in the military,” said Mike Berry, senior counsel for First Liberty.
Prelogar told the justices that the Navy has informed her that it has already been forced to send one of the challengers to Hawaii for duty on a submarine “against its military judgment.”
Prelogar stressed that SEALs and other members of the Special Warfare community can be called upon to deploy anywhere in the world on short notice to complete high-risk missions under extreme conditions. She noted that in 2009 a team of SEALs flew 8,000 miles to respond to the hijacking of a US-flagged ship by Somali pirates and ultimately played a critical role in rescuing the ship’s captain, who was being held hostage.
“The Navy has an extraordinarily compelling interest in ensuring that the servicemembers who perform those missions are as physically and medically prepared as possible,” she said, adding: “That includes vaccinating them against COVID-19, which is the least restrictive means of achieving that interest.”
She said that the US military has relied on mandatory immunization since 1777 when George Washington directed the inoculation of the Continental Army against smallpox.
The Navy currently requires nine vaccines. It allows two types of exemptions for medical and administrative reasons, which include “religious accommodations.” Those exemptions are adjudicated through Navy policies which include a 50-step process to entertain a religious accommodation request.
In the seven months since the Covid vaccine was added as a mandatory immunization, the Navy has received more than 4,000 requests for exemptions. Most remain pending, and Prelogar says the Navy has only granted one religious accommodation.
Under longstanding policy, Special Warfare servicemembers who cannot be vaccinated for religious reasons are deemed not physically qualified and cannot be assigned to an operation unit.
Prelogar said if the Supreme Court were to freeze the lower court opinion, that they would not be entitled to be assigned to or deployed on missions that “their commanding officers have determined would be jeopardized by their lack of vaccination.”",en,Biden administration asks Supreme Court to block order to deploy unvaccinated Navy SEALs,LEFT,MIXED,MEDIUM CREDIBILITY,,

The Supreme Court on Friday agreed to temporarily freeze a lower-court opinion requiring the Navy to deploy special operations forces even though they have refused to get vaccinated for Covid-19.
The court’s order means that while special operations forces – including more than two dozen Navy SEALs – continue to challenge the Navy’s vaccine mandate on religious grounds in court, they will not be actively deployed or punished for their position.
Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch dissented.
Alito, writing for himself and Gorsuch, said that he agreed that the Navy had a “compelling interest” in preventing Covid-19 infection from “impairing its ability to carry out its vital responsibilities” but that it’s “summary rejection” of requests for religious exemptions was by “no means the least restrictive means” for furthering its interests. He said the challengers “who have volunteered to undertake demanding and hazardous duties to defend our country” had been treated “shabbily” by the Navy.
Justice Brett Kavanaugh agreed with the majority and explained his thinking, saying he saw “no basis” for employing the “judicial power in a manner that military commanders believe would impair the military of the United States as it defends the American people.”
Challengers in the case – including more than two dozen Navy SEALs – say they have religious objections to the vaccine mandate and are seeking an exemption.

A federal judge granted a preliminary injunction on Monday blocking the Defense Department from taking action against a group of 35 Navy sailors who had refused to get a coronavirus vaccine, raising questions on how it might shape the Pentagon’s requirement that all U.S. troops get vaccinated. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight U.S. District Judge Reed O’Connor found that the pandemic “provides the government with no license to abrogate” the freedoms that any American has, and that the service members had a right to avoid getting a vaccination on religious grounds.
“This Court does not make light of COVID-19′s impact on the military. Collectively, our armed forces have lost over 80 lives to COVID-19 over the course of the pandemic,” O’Connor wrote Monday in a 26-page order.
But the judge added that the “loss of religious liberties outweighs any forthcoming harm to the Navy” and that “even the direst circumstances cannot justify the loss of constitutional rights.”

The troops — a group that included Navy SEALs and other members of Naval Special Warfare Command — filed suit against President Biden, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro and the Defense Department to challenge the Navy’s vaccination requirement in November. The troops cited Christian beliefs that they should not take a vaccine developed from aborted fetal cell lines and saw a modification of their bodies as an “affront to their Creator.” Many Christians have sought vaccination, with Pope Francis urging Catholics to do so on humanitarian grounds.
The suit was filed by First Liberty Institute, a nonprofit that specializes in defending religious liberty. Michael Berry, a lawyer for the institute, said in a phone interview that the ruling “sends a clear message to the Biden administration, to the Pentagon and to the Navy that our service members do not give up their religious freedom when they serve their country.”

Should the Biden administration appeal the decision, Berry said, “we will defend this as far as it needs to go.”
O’Connor noted that the Navy has a process by which service members can seek a religious accommodation to avoid vaccination but said that “by all accounts, it is theater.” Twenty-nine of the 35 troops represented in the lawsuit had seen their requests to avoid the vaccine denied, with many appealing, his ruling said.
“The Navy has not granted a religious exemption to any vaccine in recent memory,” O’Connor wrote. “It merely rubber stamps each denial.”
The injunction comes after nearly all of the more than 1 million active-duty U.S. service members received at least one coronavirus vaccination, and as the Defense Department has begun to end the military careers of those who do not. The Air Force and Marine Corps began administratively separating service members last month, while the Navy and Army were expected to begin doing so this month.
The Defense Department has seen numerous challenges since Austin mandated the vaccine in August, citing concerns about how the virus could affect the military’s readiness. The Pentagon has required other vaccinations for years, a point that senior defense officials have made repeatedly.

A federal appeals court on Feb. 28 rejected an attempt by President Joe Biden’s administration to partially lift a block on the military’s COVID-19 vaccine mandate for a group of Navy SEALs.
A federal judge in January blocked the mandate’s enforcement for 35 Navy members, many of them SEALs, ruling that while the Navy had provided a process for adjudicating religious exemption applications, “by all accounts, it is theater.”
At the time of the ruling, the Navy had granted zero religious exemptions. As of Feb. 23, it had still granted none.
Nonetheless, officials asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit to allow the military to take into account the unvaccinated status of the 35 members when making “deployment, assignment and other operational decisions.” They argued that “forcing the Navy to deploy plaintiffs while they are unvaccinated threatens the success of critical missions and needlessly endangers the health and safety of other service members.”
A three-judge panel on the court rejected the request, noting the discrepancy between how the branch has handled medical and religious exemption requests.
“The Navy has granted hundreds of medical exemptions from vaccination requirements, allowing those service members to seek medical waivers and become deployable. But it has not accommodated any religious objection to any vaccine in seven years, preventing those seeking such accommodations from even being considered for medical waivers,” the panel said.
Judges said there is apparently no template for approving requests, but there is a disapproval template form. And during the process, Navy officials sent memorandums to Vice Admiral John Nowell asking that he disapprove the exemption requests, even those based on “sincerely held religious beliefs.”
The Navy has “has effectively stacked the deck against even those exemptions supported by Plaintiffs’ immediate commanding officers and military chaplains,” emphasizing the futility of pursuing exemptions, the panel said. Further, letting 35 unvaccinated members deploy wouldn’t seriously impede military function because over 5,000 other members are still on duty despite being unvaccinated, they added.
“Defendants have not demonstrated ‘paramount interests’ that justify vaccinating these 35 Plaintiffs against COVID-19 in violation of their religious beliefs,” the ruling stated.
The panel consisted of Judges Edith Jones, a Reagan nominee; Stuart Duncan, a Trump nominee; and Kurt Engelhardt, a Trump nominee.
Mike Berry, director of military affairs for First Liberty Institute, which is representing the plaintiffs, said the group was grateful for the ruling.
“The purge of religious servicemembers is not just devastating to morale, but it harms America’s national security. It’s time for our military to honor its constitutional obligations and grant religious accommodations for service members with sincere religious objections to the vaccine,” Berry said in a statement.
The Navy declined to comment.
U.S. District Judge Reed O’Connor, the George W. Bush nominee who entered the injunction, has yet to rule on a motion to widen the preliminary injunction to all Navy members seeking a religious exemption.

Court allows Department of Defense to reassign unvaccinated Navy SEALs
By Amy Howe
at 6:20 pm
The Supreme Court on Friday gave the Pentagon the go-ahead to consider whether some members of the elite Navy SEALs are vaccinated against COVID-19 when making operational decisions. With three justices noting dissents, the court temporarily blocked an order by a federal trial court that U.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar said would commandeer “the Navy’s authority to decide which servicemembers should be deployed to execute some of the military’s most sensitive and dangerous missions.” The ruling came over the objection of a group of SEALs who oppose the Navy’s vaccination policy on religious grounds; the SEALs had argued that what the Navy really wants is “permission to engage in hostile tactics designed to coerce” the SEALs “into disregarding their religious beliefs.”
In August 2021, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin announced that all active-duty members of the military must be vaccinated against COVID-19. However, the Supreme Court’s ruling on Friday affects only the Navy’s ability to consider whether the SEALs and other members of the Naval Special Warfare Command are vaccinated when making personnel decisions – for example, about whom to deploy and where. The government had not asked the justices to allow it to enforce other aspects of its vaccine policies that the SEALs are challenging and a trial court in Texas had also blocked, such as allowing it to discipline or discharge unvaccinated servicemembers.
The Biden administration came to the Supreme Court on March 7, asking the justices to allow it to consider vaccination status while the litigation continues. The government characterized the trial court’s ruling as an “extraordinary and unprecedented intrusion into core military affairs,” and it stressed that because of the intense and high-risk nature of the SEALs’ work, the government has an “extraordinarily compelling interest in ensuring that the servicemembers who perform those missions are as physically and medically prepared as possible,” including by being vaccinated against COVID-19.
Dismissing the administration’s concerns as a “fig leaf,” the SEALs urged the justices to keep the trial court’s order in place. Not only is the COVID-19 pandemic “waning,” they wrote, but the lower court’s order merely maintains the status quo – which are the personnel decisions that the Navy has already made about how to assign the SEALs. The real problem, the SEALs suggested, is that the Navy has not “granted a single request for religious accommodation for any servicemember, though it has granted hundreds of non-religious exemptions.” The SEALs conceded that “judges should not presume to run the military,” but they emphasized that courts should also not “turn a blind eye to violations of the Constitution or the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. And the Navy cannot cloak its desire to punish” the SEALs “for requesting religious accommodation in claimed ‘operational’ needs without judicial scrutiny,” they added.
In a one-paragraph order, the Supreme Court on Friday granted the administration’s request to put part of the trial court’s order on hold while the government appeals to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit and, if necessary, the Supreme Court. Justice Clarence Thomas, who spent the past week in the hospital before being discharged Friday morning, indicated that he would have denied the government’s request.
Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House under President George W. Bush, wrote a brief concurring opinion to explain why he agreed with the decision to put part of the trial court’s ruling on hold. Kavanaugh saw the issue as a “simple” one: “Under Article II of the Constitution, the President of the United States, not any federal judge, is the Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces.” Although the trial court in this case may have been “well-intentioned,” Kavanaugh suggested, even the federal law protecting religious freedom still “does not justify judicial intrusion into military affairs in this case” because “the Navy has an extraordinarily compelling interest in maintaining strategic and operational control over the assignment and deployment of all Special Warfare personnel — including control over decisions about military readiness.” “I see,” Kavanaugh concluded, “no basis in this case for employing the judicial power in a manner that military commanders believe would impair the military of the United States as it defends the American people.”
Justice Samuel Alito dissented, in a 10-page opinion joined by Justice Neil Gorsuch. Alito complained that the challengers in this case “appear to have been treated shabbily by the Navy,” describing a lengthy and complicated exemption procedure that had not yet yielded any religious exemptions. And Alito objected to what he characterized as the broad language of the Supreme Court’s order, arguing that it would effectively give the Navy “carte blanche to warehouse” the challengers until the litigation is resolved, “which make take years.” At the same time, Alito acknowledged that he was “wary” about “judicial interference with sensitive military decision making.” Therefore, Alito explained, he would have issued a narrow order that only blocked the Biden administration from making personnel decisions for SEALs and other members of the Special Warfare Command “who are sent on missions where there is a special need to minimize the risk that the illness of a member due to COVID-19 might jeopardize the success of the mission or the safety of the team members.”

3032,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/navy-quietly-rolled-back-punishments-seals-seeking-religious-exemptions-covid-vaccine,"EXCLUSIVE: The U.S. Navy quietly rolled back an order punishing SEALs who remain unvaccinated due to their religious beliefs, according to recent court documents.
The order, ""Trident Order #12,"" disqualified SEALs seeking religious exemptions from the COVID-19 vaccine from training, traveling for deployment and conducting other standard business. It was first issued on Sept. 24, 2021 by Rear Admiral H. W. Howard, the former commander of Naval Special Warfare Command, and all special warfare forces were initially expected to come into compliance with the vaccine mandate by mid-October 2021.
The order specifically said that ""Special Operations Designated Personnel (SEAL and SWCC) refusing to receive recommended vaccines based solely on personal or religious beliefs will still be medically disqualified."" In addition, unvaccinated SEALs seeking religious accommodations would have to fill out a separate waiver to remain deployable.
The order was put on hold due to a preliminary injunction issued by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in early 2022 as part of an ongoing lawsuit brought by First Liberty Institute and Hacker Stephens LLP on behalf of 35 active-duty SEALs and three reservists seeking a religious exemption to the mandate.
However, according to a new filing in the lawsuit , the Navy quietly rolled back Trident Order #12 on May 22, 2022, a few months after the injunction was issued.
NAVY SEALS SEEKING RELIGIOUS EXEMPTIONS TO VACCINE MANDATE FACING INTIMIDATION AND HARASSMENT, SOURCES SAY
A communication order was circulated by the Navy on May 23 with the subject: ""NSWC CLOSEOUT TO TRIDENT ORDER #12 - MANDATORY VACCINATION FOR COVID-19."" NSWC refers to the Naval Special Warfare Command.
""This order rescinds reference A,"" it states, referring to ""Ref A"" as ""Trident Order #12 on COVID-19 Vaccinations.""
The May 23 communication order also said Navy commands ""will continue to follow guidance, as appropriate, regarding COVID-19 vaccination, accommodation requests, and mitigation measures.""
It is not immediately clear whether the Navy replaced the order with any other document or the reasoning behind Trident Order #12's termination. The Navy spokesperson told Fox News Digital, ""The Navy does not comment on ongoing litigation.""
According to a filing from plaintiff attorney Heather Gebelin Hacker to a Fifth Circuit clerk, the legal team representing the SEALs only became aware of the recession of the order on Sept. 1, months after it was rolled back.
""To the best of counsel’s knowledge, Trident Order #12 was not replaced. As the Court will recall, Trident Order #12 stated that SEALs who are unvaccinated due to religious beliefs are medically disqualified, though SEALs who are unvaccinated due to medical reasons are not automatically disqualified. Trident Order #12 also implemented the COVID-19 vaccine mandate at the command level for Naval Special Warfare forces, setting a deadline of compliance for October 17, 2021,"" the SEALs' legal team wrote.
""A copy of the order rescinding Trident Order #12 is attached to this letter. The rescission of Trident Order # 12 does not appear to affect the applicability of Navy or DoD-wide vaccine policies to NSW personnel—it just appears to remove the command-level direction,"" Hackeron continued.
The lawsuit representing unvaccinated SEALs, first reported by Fox News Digital in November, has since been amended to extend to a class action lawsuit encompassing all Navy service members seeking religious accommodation.
ADMIRAL WHO SAID UNVAXXED SEALS CAUSE 'IMMEDIATE HARM' TO NAVY ADMITTED NO COMBAT OPERATIONS AFFECTED
First Liberty's Senior Counsel and Director of Military Affairs Mike Berry told Fox News Digital, ""Now that the Navy has rescinded this unlawful order, the only reason it won't allow our SEALs to get back to doing their jobs is because of their religious beliefs.""
""America faces many national security threats, and the Navy is suffering a historic recruiting crisis. There's no good reason to keep these trained and experienced warriors from serving,"" Berry said.

In addition, during a recent deposition, William Lescher, the former vice chief of naval operations, stated he was ""unaware"" of any Navy SEAL combat missions that had been negatively affected by COVID-19, despite his earlier claim that the vaccine mandate was necessary for successful Navy operations.
In a sworn affidavit before the Supreme Court earlier this year, he stated that allowing unvaccinated SEALs will cause ""immediate harm to the Navy"" and ""to the national security of the United States"" and could be considered a ""dereliction of duty.""",en,Navy quietly rolled back punishments for SEALs seeking religious exemptions to the COVID vaccine,RIGHT,,,,

NAVY SEALS SEEKING RELIGIOUS EXEMPTIONS TO VACCINE MANDATE FACING INTIMIDATION AND HARASSMENT, SOURCES SAY
MIKE BERRY: Well, it all starts with the U.S. Constitution and the First Amendment, the free exercise of religion is enshrined in our Constitution as part of the bedrock foundation of this country and what our country was founded upon. And guess what? Not just the U.S. Constitution, but federal law and Department of Defense regulations themselves require the Department of Defense to honor religious freedom. We have regulations right now that say that religious accommodations should be granted and shall be granted and only in the most limited of circumstances the government has a very, very high bar that it has to meet in order to deny a religious accommodation. But we've been told from the Pentagon, from the very highest levels, that the DOD does not intend to approve any religious accommodation requests. And to my knowledge, and I've heard this from multiple sources, not a single religious accommodation has been approved at this point. And that's insane. That can't be the case. But yet that's that's exactly where we are.

In January, U.S. District Judge Reed O’Connor told the Navy that it could not discipline or discharge 35 sailors – mostly Navy SEALs – who were suing over their religious exemption denials. That order was upheld by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. Yet the Supreme Court disagreed in part and ruled that, while the special operators couldn’t be discharged, the Navy was allowed to use their vaccination status to make operational and deployment decisions.
That was Friday.

In Monday’s order, O’Connor granted the SEAL’s request to broaden the case out to a class action that includes “4,095 Navy service members who have filed religious accommodation requests,” the ruling said. That request was filed in January, according to court records.
“Without relief, each servicemember faces the threat of discharge and the consequences that accompany it,” O’Connor wrote in his order.
“Even though their personal circumstances may factually differ in small ways, the threat is the same – get the jab or lose your job,” he added.
O’Connor’s order also notes that, given the Supreme Court’s ruling, the Navy retains the power to consider sailors’ “vaccination status in making deployment, assignment, and other operational decisions.”
The Navy directed requests for comment to the Department of Justice, which did not immediately reply.
In arguing against the class certification, the government’s lawyers noted that “the Navy has a compelling interest in slowing the spread of COVID-19” and noted that this “policy choice resides with the Navy, not with its service members.”
The lawyers also rebutted claims that the rejections of the service member’s religious exemption requests were a foregone conclusion, as the SEALs alleged in various filings, by pointing out that they “provide no evidence that hundreds of military officials are acting together in bad faith to issue undifferentiated denials of each service member’s request.”
Legal experts who previously spoke with Military.com said that it appeared the lawyers for the sailors had intentionally picked a judge who would be more sympathetic to their claims.
""It's clearly forum shopping. … I don't think it's surprising that stays were obtained in very conservative districts on religious issues,"" Mark Zaid, a Washington, D.C.-based attorney who fought and prevailed over the military's last major vaccine mandate for anthrax, previously said.
Lawyers justified filing this case before the Texas court because one of the 35 defendants was stationed in Fort Worth, court records show. The Navy only has one notable base in the Texas city – a reserve naval air station – and the SEALs who made up most of the initial defendants are stationed predominantly in either Coronado, California, or Dam Neck, Virginia.
The order issued by O’Connor will likely impact several other, similar cases filed across the country, like the one in Florida filed by 30 unnamed officers and service members.
The judge in that case, which also sought to become a class-action lawsuit, ruled in March that the Navy cannot remove one of the plaintiffs, a destroyer commander, for refusing the COVID-19 vaccine.
As of last Wednesday, the Navy has discharged just over 650 active-duty and reserve sailors over the vaccine mandate.
Although the branch has not granted any exemption requests to active-duty sailors, it did grant nine conditional approvals to members of the Individual Ready Reserve, a non-drilling component of the reserve corps, with the understanding that, if called up, those sailors would become fully vaccinated.

2718,heritage.org,https://www.heritage.org/courts/commentary/court-delivers-win-military-members-denied-religious-exemptions-pentagon-vaccine,"In one of many ongoing federal lawsuits challenging COVID-19 vaccine mandates across the country, Judge Reed O’Connor of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas issued a group of Navy SEALs and Naval Special Warfare personnel a resounding victory Jan. 3 in U.S. Navy SEALs 1-26 v. Biden.
In his order, O’Connor granted an injunction against the Biden administration and the Department of Defense, preventing them from enforcing the vaccine mandate against any of the named service members who had applied for a religious exemption.
O’Connor ruled that the blanket denial of their religious waiver requests amounted to a violation of the service members’ rights under the First Amendment and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.
Under that law, the government may substantially burden a person’s exercise of religion only if it demonstrates that burden is (1) in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest; and (2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that interest.
For O’Connor, the violation of the law was clear:
Defendants have substantially burdened Plaintiffs’ religious beliefs. The government burdens religion when it ‘put[s] substantial pressure on an adherent to modify his behavior and to violate his beliefs.’ That is especially true when the government imposes a choice between one’s job and one’s religious belief. Here, Plaintiffs must decide whether to lose their livelihoods or violate sincerely held religious beliefs. Because they will not compromise these religious beliefs, Plaintiffs have been threatened with separation from the military and other disciplinary action.
Like the other service branches, the Navy required all active-duty service members to be fully vaccinated before Nov. 28 or risk a “full range” of disciplinary action.
While it allowed service members to apply for religious exemptions to the mandate, it has not granted a single one. In fact, as of Dec. 17, the religious accommodation requests of at least 29 of the 35 naval plaintiffs had been flatly denied.
The Navy has, however, granted medical exemption requests submitted by other personnel.
This disparity of treatment between medical and religious exemptions was constitutionally prohibited, O’Connor said:
As a brief preview, the vaccine mandate fails strict scrutiny. The mandate treats comparable secular activity (e.g., medical exemptions) more favorably than religious activity.
The service members who filed the lawsuit represent more than 350 collective years of military service, and more than 100 combat deployments. When they inquired about seeking religious accommodation for the vaccine, the Navy informed many of them that they could face court-martial or involuntary separation if they refused to take the vaccine.
According to the First Liberty Institute, the public interest law firm representing the service members, each of the denials appeared to be identical, suggesting the Navy had not taken any of the religious exemption requests seriously.
O’Connor made note of this in his order, calling the process for seeking a religious exemption nothing more than “theater,” stating that the Navy “merely rubber-stamps each denial,” and stressing that “the record overwhelmingly demonstrates that the Navy’s religious-accommodation process is an exercise in futility.”
“The Navy service members in this case seek to vindicate the very freedoms they have sacrificed so much to protect,” O’Connor wrote, adding:
The COVID-19 pandemic provides the government no license to abrogate those freedoms. There is no COVID-19 exception to the First Amendment. There is no military exclusion from our Constitution.
Mike Berry, general counsel for First Liberty Institute, said:
Forcing a service member to choose between their faith and serving their country is abhorrent to the Constitution and America’s values … . Punishing SEALs for simply asking for a religious accommodation is purely vindictive and punitive. We’re pleased that the court has acted to protect our brave warriors before more damage is done to our national security.
The next stop in the litigation is likely to be an appeal by the Department of Defense and the Biden administration to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit.
Other federal court challenges to various COVID-19 vaccine mandates are ongoing.
On Jan. 7, the Supreme Court is set to hear oral arguments in a set of high-profile, consolidated cases on the Biden administration’s vaccine mandates for private-sector entities with 100 or more employees, and for health care facilities that receive Medicaid and Medicare funding.
The Heritage Foundation, a petitioner in the case challenging the private-sector vaccine mandate, has asked the court to invalidate the government’s order. (The Daily Signal is the news outlet of The Heritage Foundation.)
While the Jan. 3 victory applies only to the named naval personnel in the lawsuit and not to the entire vaccine mandate issued by the Department of Defense, for religious freedom advocates and faithful Americans, the victory is a breath of fresh air and a much-needed reminder that individuals who have selflessly committed themselves to the defense of the Constitution and its enshrined liberties are sometimes the very people whose rights need defending the most.

The Supreme Court on Friday allowed the Biden administration to take into account whether members of the military, including elite Navy SEALs, are vaccinated against the coronavirus when making deployment decisions. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel A. Alito Jr. and Neil M. Gorsuch dissented from the short, unsigned order.
Writing for himself, Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh said “the President of the United States, not any federal judge, is the Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces.” He added there was “no basis in this case for employing the judicial power in a manner that military commanders believe would impair the military of the United States as it defends the American people.”
The order put on hold the judgments of a lower court and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, which had stopped the administration from making such decisions.
Solicitor General Elizabeth B. Prelogar had asked the Supreme Court to block at least part of the appeals court decision, calling it an “extraordinary and unprecedented intrusion into core military affairs.”

That ruling “not only prohibits the Navy from applying the COVID-19 vaccination requirement to respondents, but also requires the Navy to assign and deploy them without regard to their lack of vaccinations notwithstanding military leaders’ judgment that doing so poses intolerable risks to safety and mission success,” she wrote.
The challengers to the military’s policy are 35 Navy service members assigned to the Naval Special Warfare Command, including 26 Navy SEALs.
The dispute arises from last year’s announcement by Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin that all members of the military must get vaccinated against the coronavirus. All Navy personnel were to receive their first dose of the vaccine or request an exemption by October, and officials indicated those who were not vaccinated could be reassigned, even if they had received an exemption.

A district judge blocked the Navy from enforcing the policy, saying the Navy could achieve “herd immunity” even if some members were not vaccinated, and blocked any retaliation against those requesting religious exemptions.
The court denied the Biden administration’s request to put on hold the part of the order that said deployment decisions couldn’t be made on the basis of vaccination status, and the appeals court turned it down as well.
The service members, represented by the conservative religious law organization First Liberty, said the Navy should not be allowed to discriminate against those who requested a religious exemption.
“The evidence shows that before those requests, the Navy assigned plaintiffs to their current duty stations and even successfully deployed many of them during the pandemic despite vaccination status,” their brief to the Supreme Court said. “But the Navy has not granted a single request for religious accommodation for any service member, though it has granted hundreds of nonreligious exemptions.”

It added, “While judges should not presume to run the military, neither may courts turn a blind eye to violations of the Constitution” or federal law.
Alito and Gorsuch said they would have allowed the injunction to remain in place.
“By rubber-stamping the Government’s request for what it calls a ‘partial stay,’ the Court does a great injustice to the 35 respondents — Navy SEALs and others in the Naval Special Warfare community — who have volunteered to undertake demanding and hazardous duties to defend our country,” Alito wrote. “These individuals appear to have been treated shabbily by the Navy, and the Court brushes all that aside.”
Though compliance with the Pentagon’s requirement is well above 90 percent overall, thousands of service members remain unvaccinated against the coronavirus, pending waiver requests. To date, about 2,200 troops have been dismissed from the military for failing to comply with the mandate. Only the Army National Guard and the Army Reserve have yet to reach their compliance deadlines. Those soldiers have until the end of June to receive a shot or seek an exemption.
The case is Austin v. U.S. Navy SEALS.

As reported by The Daily Caller, the court’s ruling was similar to a previous decision by a district judge in Fort Worth, Texas in January, who ordered a temporary halt to the Navy’s vaccine mandate while the case moved forward. The lawsuit was filed by a group of 35 Navy SEALs who all sought religious exemptions from being forced to take the vaccine.
The appeals court ruled that the Department of Defense failed to prove that the vaccine mandate served “‘paramount interests’ that justify vaccinating these 35 Plaintiffs against COVID-19 in violation of their religious beliefs.” The court noted that despite the Navy claiming to have a “compelling interest” in forcing all sailors to get vaccinated, it “undermined” its own mandate by preparing unvaccinated SEALs for deployment while the pandemic was still ongoing.
Furthermore, the court pointed out that the Navy had already granted religious exemptions to at least 17 service members who previously requested such exemptions, and the Navy failed to “differentiate those service members from [the] Plaintiffs.” In conclusion, the court wrote, the “Defendants have not shown a compelling interest to deny religious accommodations to each of these 35 Plaintiffs.”
The vaccine mandate for the U.S. military was first announced in August of 2021 by Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, who ordered that every branch of the military force all members to get vaccinated.

In the emergency court filing, solicitor general Elizabeth Prelogar alleged that the lower court’s order “usurps the Navy’s authority to decide which servicemembers should be deployed to execute some of the military’s most sensitive and dangerous missions.”
Earlier this year, a federal judge for the U.S. District Court Texas’ Northern District temporarily blocked the U.S. Navy from kicking out 35 Naval Special Warfare members seeking religious exemptions to the military-wide COVID-19 vaccine mandate implemented by Biden’s administration.
“The district court granted that extraordinary relief,” Prelogar said. “The court’s preliminary injunction not only prohibits the Navy from applying the COVID-19 vaccination requirement to respondents, but also requires the Navy to assign and deploy them without regard to their lack of vaccinations notwithstanding military leaders’ judgement that doing so poses intolerable risks to safety and mission success.”
“Indeed, the Navy has informed this Office that the injunction has already compelled it to send one respondent to Hawaii for duty on a submarine against its military judgment,” she continued. “Other respondents occupy positions that may require them to be ‘deploy[ed] anywhere in the world in the immediate future.’”
The solicitor general argued that the order amounts to an “extraordinary and unprecedented intrusion into core military affairs.”
In his decision to grant a preliminary injunction, U.S. District Court Judge Reed O’Connor wrote, “The Navy has not granted a religious exemption to any vaccine in recent memory. It merely rubber stamps each denial.”
“The Navy service members in this case seek to vindicate the very freedoms they have sacrificed so much to protect,” O’Connor continued. “The COVID-19 pandemic provides the government no license to abrogate those freedoms. There is no COVID-19 exception to the First Amendment. There is no military exclusion from our Constitution.”
While quoting Admiral William K. Lescher, Vice Chief of Naval Operations and the second-highest uniformed officer in the Navy, Prelogar argued that the injunction will negatively impact mission readiness of special-operations forces, as well as “’break[] down good order and discipline’, ‘unnecessarily limit the Navy’s ability to conduct daily operations and operational missions’, and risk ‘mission failure in contingencies and crises that cause harm to national security.’”
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit chose not to block O’Connor’s order on Feb. 28.

At a Glance
The Biden administration seeks to halt an order forcing the military to deploy unvaccinated special forces soldiers.
Last month, a Texas judge ruled in favor of 35 SEALs who said mandates violated their religious freedoms.
However, the Pentagon claims unvaccinated soliders “compromise the mission.”
The Biden Administration Asks to the Supreme Court to Stop Military from Deploying Unvaccinated Navy SEALs
The application comes after a federal judge in Texas temporarily blocked the Department of Defense from banning the deployment of Navy SEALS who will not comply with the miliary’s COVID vaccine mandate. The decision also forbids commanders from changing assignments because of the SEALs’ vaccine status.
Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar is asking the Supreme Court to block the portion of the ruling that will force the Navy to ship out 35 unvaccinated special operations members before allowing the appeals process to play out. Prelogar is not challenging the decision to protect the soldiers from discipline or discharge, though.
“This application seeks relief from a preliminary injunction that usurps the Navy’s authority to decide which servicemembers should be deployed to execute some of the military’s most sensitive and dangerous missions,” she wrote in the application.
According to Vice Chief of Naval Operations Admiral William K. Lescher, the block would be in the interest of national security. Because in his opinion, one COVID infection could “compromise the mission.”
“The Navy has an extraordinarily compelling interest in ensuring that the service members who perform those missions are as physically and medically prepared as possible,” the filing reads. “That includes vaccinating them against COVID-19, which is the least restrictive means of achieving that interest.”
The administration attempted to involve a district court and a federal appeals court already. The former ruled in favor of the Texas judge. And the latter refused to step in.
Texas Judge Ruled in Favor of Navy SEALs Who Claimed the Military Violated Their Religious and Constitutional Rights
Texas U.S. District Judge Reed O’Connor issued the stay after the First Liberty Institute argued on behalf of 35 active-duty SEALs and three reservists.
The soldiers were all members of Christian churches who said that the vaccine mandates violated their constitutional rights and also “their sincerely held religious beliefs.”
“The Navy service members, in this case, seek to vindicate the very freedoms they have sacrificed so much to protect. The COVID-19 pandemic provides the government no license to abrogate those freedoms,” O’Conner wrote. “There is no COVID-19 exception to the First Amendment.

The Biden administration is asking the U.S. Supreme Court to reinstate a major portion of its program mandating members of the military to be vaccinated against COVID-19.
In January a federal district court judge in Texas issued an order barring the Navy from requiring all SEALs to be vaccinated for COVID-19. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the order, and also refused to temporarily suspend its decision pending appeal.
In an emergency appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, the Defense Department is arguing that the lower courts have usurped the president's core constitutional power — and by extension the military's power — to make decisions as to ""which service members should be deployed to execute some of the military's most sensitive and dangerous missions."" And that, the Pentagon said in its brief, imperils military readiness, noting that in one case the Navy has already been forced, against its best judgment, to deploy an unvaccinated Navy SEAL for duty on a close-quartered submarine.
Vice Chief of Naval Operations Adm. William K. Lescher filed a sworn declaration in the case, saying that the illness of even one member of a small SEAL team due to COVID-19 could compromise a mission. He said it would be ""a dereliction of duty"" to allow unvaccinated personnel into an environment in which they ... risk the lives of others.""
The case now before the high court began when a group of Navy SEALs and other members of the elite Naval Special Warfare community went to court to challenge to the military's COVID-19 vaccination requirement, issued in August of 2021 after the FDA granted full approval of the vaccine. The challengers maintained that the vaccination requirement violated the Religious Freedom Restoration Act because it did not sufficiently accommodate religious objectors.
The military replied that mandatory vaccinations for the military date back to George Washington, who directed the inoculation of the Continental Army against smallpox in 1777. Currently, there are nine vaccines required for military members, with exemptions for medical reasons — most notably, pregnancy — and religious reasons. Military regulations set out rules procedures for disciplining and ultimately separating service members who refuse vaccination without an exemption.
The regulations also provide that ""service members who are not vaccinated, regardless of exemption status, may be temporarily reassigned"" based on ""operational readiness and mission requirements.""
Federal District Judge Reed O'Connor invalidated the vaccination mandate, finding that the challengers, prior to the mandate, had carried out their jobs safely. O'Connor said that the Navy lacks a compelling interest in mitigating the risks of COVID-19 because SEALs face other hazards — including ""everything from gunshot wounds"" to ""parachute accidents"" that may ""create risks of equal or greater magnitude than the virus."" He further said that allowing service members to remain unvaccinated would not prevent the Navy from achieving ""herd immunity,"" given the high level of compliance in the military services.
A panel of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, based in Texas, upheld the ruling, and also, like O'Connor, refused to temporarily suspend the compliance order pending appeal. The panel included two Trump appointees, Judges Kyle Duncan and Kurt Engelhardt, and Reagan appointee Edith Jones.
On Monday the government filed an emergency appeal at the Supreme Court, focused only on the challengers assertion that the Pentagon cannot change a service member's assignment if he or she is not vaccinated. As it did in the lower courts, it is seeking a partial stay for now. ""SEALs and other members of the Special Warfare community can be called upon to deploy anywhere in the world on short notice, to complete high-risk missions under extreme conditions; and to operate in small teams and close quarters for extended periods,"" the government argues.
That alone, it maintains, is reason enough to leave the current regulations in place while the litigation proceeds on the merits.",en,Pentagon asks Supreme Court to allow it to stop the deployment of unvaccinated SEALs,LEFT-CENTER,,,,
1582,frc.org,http://www.frc.org/updatearticle/20220303/rank-appeals,"President Biden offered an olive branch in his Tuesday State of the Union address, but he only delivered a fig leaf. The rhetoric was inspiring: ""We can't change how divided we've been. But we can change how we move forward -- on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together."" The reality was quite different. Just the day before, the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the Justice Department's appeal of a preliminary injunction, which prevents the Navy from punishing SEALs who are challenging the military COVID vaccine mandate on religious grounds while the lawsuit proceeds through the courts.
It's unclear why the Biden administration is continuing this legal fight against servicemembers with conscience objections to the COVID vaccine. More than 97 percent of active-duty military personnel are vaccinated. The latest variant, Omicron, was milder and more survivable, and has mostly burnt itself out anyways. Just in time for the State of the Union, the CDC and the House of Representatives both loosened their masking guidelines in an effort to move on from the pandemic. Dragged along by public opinion and the reopening of even the strictest Democrat-run states, the Biden administration seems as if they are finally coming to terms with the reality that the COVID-19 pandemic is over, three years after it began.
Yet while the Biden administration tries to pivot away from the pandemic and towards the ongoing foreign policy crisis in Europe, the justice department and military branches continue oppressing servicemembers with religious objections to the vaccine. ""We've been fighting the administration tooth-and-nail, step-by-step, against this vaccine mandate,"" said Mike Berry, Director of Military Affairs for First Liberty Institute. What is the point anymore? ""With all of the threats to America,"" said Berry, ""you would think that the Department of Defense would want to be welcoming people with the type of elite skills that our Navy SEALs have.""
The problem goes beyond First Liberty's clients. Only fifteen military religious exemptions have been approved, out 16,000 requested. The Marine Corps has granted six exemptions out of 3,595 and have ""separated"" 640 Marines. The Army and Navy have granted none of the 3,088 and 3,369 exemption requests, respectively; the Navy has fired 269 sailors, while the Army ""only recently put into place its separation policy."" The Air Force has approved the most exemptions, a measly nine, but they have also rejected 3,381 with another 2,664 requests pending. In approving an Air Force officer's exemption in a separate case in Georgia, a judge asked, ""What real interest can our military leaders have in furthering a requirement that violates the very document they swore to support and defend?"" That great question has no good answer.
Our military faces the same spiritual crisis gripping the entire nation. Having turned their backs on God, Americans now feel the need to exert godlike control over their lives. When something they can't control (like a global pandemic or a needless war) explodes that fantasy, they are paralyzed by fear. That's why we spent weeks and months trapped in our homes by government edict, and why we've imposed a reading disability crisis on children to make ourselves feel better.
This newfound obsession with control tends dangerously towards authoritarianism. ""Religious freedom is always one of the first flashpoints in those regimes because the one thing... an authoritarian will never tolerate is people who will say, I submit to a higher authority,'"" said Berry. Like butterflies or canaries, the military's intolerance of faith is a warning of impending hostility throughout society. But since acting against conscience ""is neither right nor safe,"" we must keep standing.",en,Rank Overreach and Filed Appeals,FAR RIGHT,,,,

The court’s decision follows a Fort Worth district judge’s temporary halt to Biden’s mandate in early January while the case was under consideration, according to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. The original mandate, which required service members receive their second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine by November 2021, was challenged by a group of active duty Navy SEALs seeking religious exemptions.

The court found that Biden’s Department of Defense (DOD) did not demonstrate “‘paramount interests’ that justify vaccinating these 35 Plaintiffs against COVID-19 in violation of their religious beliefs.” The court also stated that the Navy prepared unvaccinated SEALs for deployment during the pandemic, which “undermined” the Navy’s alleged “compelling interest” in a vaccine mandate.
The court also noted that the Navy had provided exemptions to 17 other service members without giving a reason for “differentiating those service members from Plaintiffs.” Additionally, the ruling stated that the Navy did not give reasons specific to the plaintiffs in their letters denying religious exemptions.
Ultimately, the court agreed with the district judge’s ruling to halt the vaccine mandate, stating that “Defendants have not shown a compelling interest to deny religious accommodations to each of these 35 Plaintiffs.”",en,Navy SEALs Notch Another Win Against Biden Admin Vaccine Mandate After Federal Court Appeals Court Ruling,RIGHT,MIXED,MEDIUM CREDIBILITY,,

The bestselling author and podcaster posted his impassioned rendition of the Founding Father’s famous address on Instagram on Monday.
Willink also linked to the video on Twitter, where he exhorted his followers to heed a “timeless message from the past: Encouragement and strength to those who stand and fight for the cause of freedom. A warning to the tyrants and their agents who seek to subjugate free people.”

Willink did not explain what inspired his rendition of Henry’s iconic 1775 speech, but it was widely understood to be a rebuke of the ongoing government overreach concerning coronavirus restrictions and mandates.
The decorated Navy veteran appeared to recite the speech from memory, emphasizing certain phrases that are alarmingly relevant to the tyrannical times we’re living in now.
“Let us not, I beseech you, sir, deceive ourselves,” Willink said. “We have done everything that could be done to avert the storm which is now coming on.
“We have petitioned. We have remonstrated. We have supplicated. We have prostrated ourselves before the throne and have implored its interposition to arrest the tyrannical hands of the ministry and Parliament.
“But our petitions have been slighted. Our remonstrances have produced additional violence and insult. Our supplications have been disregarded, and we have been spurned, with contempt, from the foot of the throne.
“In vain, after these things, may we indulge in fond hope of peace and reconciliation? There is no longer any room for hope.
“If we wish to be free, we must fight! I repeat it, sir, we must fight! An appeal to arms and to the God of Hosts is all that is left us!
“They tell us that we are weak — unable to cope with so formidable an adversary. But when shall we be stronger? Will it be the next week, or the next year? Will it be when we are totally disarmed, and when a British guard shall be stationed in every house?
“Shall we gather strength by irresolution and inaction? Shall we acquire the means of effectual resistance by lying supinely on our backs and hugging the delusive phantom of hope until our enemies shall have us bound hand and foot?
“Sir, we are not weak if we make a proper use of those means which the God of nature hath placed in our power.
“The millions of people — armed in the holy cause of liberty and in such a country as that which we possess — are invincible by any force which our enemy can send against us.
“Besides, sir, we shall not fight our battles alone. There is a just God who presides over the destinies of nations, and who will raise up friends to fight our battles with us.
“The battle, sir, is not to the strong alone. It is to the vigilant, the active, the brave. There is no retreat but in submission and slavery.
“Our chains are forged. The war is inevitable — and let it come! I repeat it, sir, let it come! It is in vain, sir, to extenuate the matter. Gentlemen may cry, ‘Peace, peace’ — but there is no peace. The war has actually begun. The next gale that sweeps from the north will bring to our ears the clash of resounding arms.
“Our brethren are already in the field! Why stand we here idle? What is it that we gentlemen wish? What would they have?
“Is life so dear or peace so sweet as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty God!
“I know not what course others may take, but as for me, give me liberty or give me death!”
The speech Willink recited exhorted Americans to take a stand against government tyranny or they’ll cede their rights to power-hungry bureaucrats forever.
The Navy SEAL’s numerous fans urged him to run for political office.

On Monday, Justin Trudeau, the liberal prime minister of Canada, took the extraordinary step of invoking that nation’s Emergencies Act to put down peaceful trucker demonstrations against his draconian vaccine mandates.
Ironically, the “vast majority” of Canadian truckers are vaccinated but oppose forced vaccinations as a violation of bodily integrity and personal freedom.
Trudeau’s administration then went a step further by threatening to suspend the insurance on the protesters’ trucks and freeze their bank accounts.

The mandate, which required all active-duty Navy service members to be fully vaccinated by Nov. 28, is being challenged by a group of U.S. Navy SEALs and other Naval special warfare personnel. The group says the mandate violates their religious freedom and that they have unjustly been denied religious exemptions from receiving the vaccine.
Their lawsuit is against President Joe Biden, the Department of Defense, the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of the Navy.
In early January, U.S. District Judge Reed O'Connor of the Northern District of Texas signed a preliminary injunction blocking the mandate while the case reaches a final judgment.
On Monday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit denied the Department of Defense's emergency stay request, which would have allowed the mandate to go into effect as the case goes through courts.
""[Evidence] suggests that the Navy has effectively stacked the deck against even those exemptions supported by Plaintiffs' immediate commanding officers and military chaplains,"" the three-judge panel said.
First Liberty Institute, a nonprofit interest law firm based in Plano, is representing the SEALs and other personnel in the suit.

The Pentagon asked the Supreme Court to intervene after Judge Reed O’Connor granted a temporary injunction to a group of Navy SEALs from taking the Biden COVID vaccine mandate based on their requested religious exemptions.
The decision stopped the Department of Defense from punishing a group of 35 Navy special operations forces who refused to get vaccinated for Covid-19.
“This application seeks relief from a preliminary injunction that usurps the Navy’s authority to decide which servicemembers should be deployed to execute some of the military’s most sensitive and dangerous missions,” Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar argued.

“The court’s preliminary injunction not only prohibits the Navy from applying the COVID-19 vaccination requirement to respondents but also requires the Navy to assign and deploy them without regard to their lack of vaccinations notwithstanding military leaders’ judgment that doing so poses intolerable risks to safety and mission success,” she continued.
According to the letter addressed to the Supreme Court, it stated that the court should grant a partial stay for two reasons:
First, even if respondents’ claims had merit, respondents would not be entitled to an injunction dictating the Navy’s de-
ployment, assignment, and operational decisions. RFRA authorizes a court to issue only “appropriate relief,” 42 U.S.C. 2000bb-1(c), and respondents’ Free Exercise claims likewise would support only relief that comports with “traditional principles of equity jurisdiction.” An injunction that trenches on core Article II prerogatives concerning which military servicemembers are qualified for which missions is inconsistent with those traditional principles and has no precedent in our Nation’s history. Second, respondents’ claims lack merit. SEALs and other members of the Special Warfare community can be called upon to deploy anywhere in the world on short notice; to complete high-risk missions under extreme conditions; and to operate in small teams and close quarters for extended periods. To take just one well-publicized example, in 2009 a team of SEALs flew 8,000 miles to respond to the hijacking of a U.S. flagged ship by Somali pirates and ultimately played a critical role in rescuing the ship’s captain, who was being held hostage. The Navy has an extraordinarily compelling interest in ensuring that the servicemembers who perform those missions are as physically and medically prepared as possible. That includes vaccinating them against COVID-19, which is the least restrictive means of achieving that interest.
COVID numbers finally dropped off in the past month due not to the vaccines but to herd immunity brought on by the Omicron variant. Yet, the Biden regime still insists on pushing their mandates on healthy young men who don’t need it.",en,Biden Administration Asks Supreme Court to Intervene after Federal Judge's Decision Blocks Navy SEALs from Vaccine Mandate,FAR RIGHT,,,,TRUE
2023,washingtontimes.com,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2022/mar/7/biden-doj-goes-supreme-court-restart-covid-19-vacc/,"The Biden administration on Monday asked the Supreme Court to unblock a COVID-19 vaccination mandate for the military and allow the Navy to consider vaccination status when deploying service members.
A lower court imposed the injunction after service members challenged the mandate, citing religious exemptions. The administration said the injunction usurps the Navy’s authority on making decisions about which military personnel serve in what capacity.
The filing notes one service member who is unvaccinated had to deploy on a submarine, against the wishes of officials.
“This application seeks relief from a preliminary injunction that usurps the Navy’s authority to decide which service members should be deployed to execute some of the military’s most sensitive and dangerous missions,” the filing read.
“The Navy has an extraordinarily compelling interest in ensuring that the service members who perform those missions are as physically and medically prepared as possible. That includes vaccinating them against COVID-19, which is the least restrictive means of achieving that interest,” the Biden administration argued.
The petition was presented to Justice Samuel A. Alito. He could grant or deny the request on his own, or refer it to the full court.
The challenge to the vaccine mandate was brought by 35 Navy SEALs and other personnel, challenging the COVID-19 vaccine requirement in the military sans religious exemptions.
The district court issued an injunction against the government’s mandate and the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit denied the government’s request to lift the injunction, prompting the Biden administration to go to the high court.
Justice Alito asked the lawyers for the servicemen to respond by next Monday to the government’s request.
Mike Berry, senior counsel for First Liberty Institute, which has filed lawsuits challenging the military’s shot requirement, said the lower courts got it right.
“There is no COVID exception to our Constitution. But the Biden Administration appears to be more interested in promoting its harmful agenda than in defending the Constitution,” Mr. Berry said.

3442,justthenews.com,https://justthenews.com/nation/religion/navy-quietly-rescinds-order-punishing-seals-religious-exemptions-covid-vax-mandate,"The Navy quietly rescinded an order to punish SEALs who sought religious exemptions to the military's COVID-19 vaccine mandate, recent court documents state.
On Sept. 24, 2021, Vice Chief of Naval Operations Admiral William Lescher issued ""Trident Order #12,"" which disqualified SEALs who sought religious exemptions from the COVID vaccine mandate from traveling for deployment, training, and conducting other standard business. According to the order, all special warfare forces were to initially comply with the vaccine mandate by mid-October 2021.
SEALs who refused ""to receive recommended vaccines based solely on personal or religious beliefs"" were ""medically disqualified,"" and thus, ""non-deployable.""
The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals placed the order on hold by issuing a preliminary injunction against it early this year in a lawsuit by 35 active-duty SEALs and three reservists who sought religious exemptions to the mandate.
A new filing in the lawsuit states that the order was quietly rescinded by the Navy on May 22, 2022, according to Fox News. However, the legal team representing the SEALs didn't learn of it until Sept. 1, over three months later.
A communication order on May 23 regarding the rescinded order said that Navy commands ""will continue to follow guidance, as appropriate, regarding COVID-19 vaccination, accommodation requests, and mitigation measures.""
It is not clear if the order has been replaced or what the reasoning behind rescinding it was, as the Navy declined to comment on ongoing litigation, Fox News reported.
""To the best of counsel's knowledge, Trident Order #12 was not replaced,"" the SEALs' legal team wrote in a new filing. ""As the Court will recall, Trident Order #12 stated that SEALs who are unvaccinated due to religious beliefs are medically disqualified, though SEALs who are unvaccinated due to medical reasons are not automatically disqualified. Trident Order #12 also implemented the COVID-19 vaccine mandate at the command level for Naval Special Warfare forces, setting a deadline of compliance for October 17, 2021.
""A copy of the order rescinding Trident Order #12 is attached to this letter. The rescission of Trident Order # 12 does not appear to affect the applicability of Navy or DoD-wide vaccine policies to NSW personnel—it just appears to remove the command-level direction.""
The lawsuit has been extended into a class action lawsuit for all Navy service members seeking religious exemptions to the vaccine mandate.
First Liberty's Senior Counsel and Director of Military Affairs Mike Berry, who represents the SEALs in the lawsuit, told Fox News, ""Now that the Navy has rescinded this unlawful order, the only reason it won't allow our SEALs to get back to doing their jobs is because of their religious beliefs.""

Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel A. Alito Jr. and Neil M. Gorsuch dissented.
The decision is a victory for the Biden administration and Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III, who last year required all service personnel to be vaccinated. In November, the Pentagon said 99.4% of the troops were vaccinated.

In a brief unsigned order, the justices set aside lower court rulings that would prevent “the Navy from considering respondents’ vaccination status in making deployment, assignment, and other operational decisions.”
Under the Constitution, “the president of the United States, not any federal judge, is the Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces,” Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh said in a concurring opinion. “I see no basis in this case for employing the judicial power in a manner that military commanders believe would impair the military of the United States as it defends the American people.”
In dissent, Alito and Gorsuch faulted the majority for “rubber stamping” the government’s vaccination order and for “brushing aside” the religious objections raised by the SEALS.
In recent months, the justices stopped the federal government from enforcing vaccination mandates on all private employers, but they have allowed states, hospitals and school districts to require vaccinations for their own employees.
For decades, the high court has repeatedly said judges must defer to the military and its commanders on matters involving order and discipline within the ranks.
But in January, U.S. District Judge Reed O’Connor in Fort Worth, Texas ruled that the Navy may not discipline or discriminate against 36 SEALS and other special forces who refused to be vaccinated citing religious reasons.
He said some of them believed aborted fetal cells played a key role in developing the vaccine, while others cited “direct, divine instruction not to receive the vaccine.” He said these beliefs “are undisputedly sincere, and it is not the role of this court to determine their truthfulness or accuracy.”
The judge issued an order telling the Navy it may not refuse to deploy SEALS on any mission because of their refusal to be vaccinated. Last month, the 5th Circuit Court in New Orleans refused the government’s request to lift his order.
In appealing to the high court, U.S. Solicitor Gen. Elizabeth B. Prelogar called the decision an “extraordinary and unprecedented intrusion into core military affairs.” She said that prior to the outbreak of the new coronavirus, nine vaccines had been required of all service members. And the history of the policy dates back to 1777, when George Washington required members of his Continental Army to be vaccinated against smallpox.
She cited the testimony of Adm. William K. Lescher, vice chief of Naval Operations and the second-highest uniformed officer in the Navy, who said the illness of “even one member” of a small SEAL team due to COVID-19 could “compromise the mission.”
He said he would regard it as a “dereliction of duty” to order “unvaccinated personnel into an environment in which they endanger their lives,” risk “the lives of others,” and “compromise accomplishment of essential missions.”
The Biden administration’s attorney did not ask the high court to overrule the judge’s decision entirely but, rather, to limit its impact. She said the order not only shields the SEALS from being disciplined or discharged, but also “requires the Navy to assign and deploy them without regard to their lack of vaccinations notwithstanding military leaders’ judgment,” she said. “Doing so poses intolerable risks to safety and mission success.”
O’Connor’s courtroom in Fort Worth is a friendly forum for conservative causes. In 2018, he ruled the Affordable Care Act was entirely unconstitutional, a decision overturned by the Supreme Court on a 7-2 vote.",en,Supreme Court rules for Navy and its vaccine requirement,LEFT-CENTER,,,,

The move was 6-3. Justice Clarence Thomas, Justice Samuel Alito and Justice Neil M. Gorsuch would have allowed the lower court order barring vaccination status from being considered to stay in place while the litigation continues on appeal.
Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh wrote separately to say he believed the president as commander in chief was the decision-maker for the military, not a federal judge.
“The Navy has an extraordinarily compelling interest in maintaining strategic and operational control over the assignment and deployment of all Special Warfare personnel — including control over decisions about military readiness,” he wrote.

Justice Alito wrote a dissent, joined by Justice Gorsuch saying they would have let the lower court order stay in place due to the treatment of the Navy SEALs.
“These individuals appear to have been treated shabbily by the Navy, and the Court brushes all that aside. I would not do so,” he wrote.

Under O’Connor’s order, the SEALs and others could not be punished, reassigned or separated, nor taken off of deployable duty status.
“The Navy service members in this case seek to vindicate the very freedoms they have sacrificed so much to protect,” O’Connor wrote. “The COVID-19 pandemic provides the government no license to abrogate those freedoms.

The Supreme Court decision came just as all four military branches ramped up the number of troops kicked out for refusing COVID-19 vaccinations, while approved religious accommodations remain vanishingly rare.
According to the latest numbers compiled by Coffee or Die Magazine on the active-duty forces from all four services, only 31 total religious accommodations have been granted out of 18,512 requests — a rate of 0.17%.
The Marine Corps has removed the most, with 1,329 Marines now separated — that’s far more than the number of those kicked out of the other three services combined. The Marines have approved six religious exemptions, according to Capt. Andrew Wood, communication strategy officer for the Marine Corps Communication Directorate, out of 3,664 requests.
The Army has approved just two religious exemptions out of 4,034, and has separated only 27 soldiers.
The Air Force has separated 222 airmen while approving just 23 religious exemptions out of 7,494.
The Navy has processed 652 separations from the service, and has yet to approve any religious exemptions out of 3,320.
The Air Force, Navy, and Marines all set vaccination deadlines in November 2021, while the Army’s was Dec. 15, 2021.
The Navy noted in its most recent release of vaccine numbers that all separated sailors received honorable discharges, other than those who were still in initial phases of training and received entry level separations.

""Continuing to ignore this SEAL's medical needs, even in the face of the Court’s explicit recognition of the harm to this SEAL in the preliminary-injunction order, is simply inexcusable.""
The SEAL offered to pay for his own travel to treatment, but was denied after ""multiple high-ranking Naval officers in SEAL 26's command began calling the treatment center and asking if it would deny treatment to someone who is unvaccinated,"" which delayed his request and caused his spot at the treatment center to be lost.
Another plaintiff has been forced to remain at a training location for four months instead of four weeks and ""is required to get special permission from the Commanding Officer to leave the base for any reason, even to get groceries or fill his car with gas,"" according to the motion.
Meanwhile, other SEALs are also being denied opportunities for training and deployment.
""It is reprehensible that the Navy would deny health care to a Navy SEAL suffering the effects of traumatic brain injury,"" Mike Berry, general counsel for First Liberty Institute, said in a statement.
""Despite the Court's clear order prohibiting this kind of vindictive abuse, the Navy continues to punish and harass these warriors,"" he alleged. ""The Navy continues to deny our clients training and deployment opportunities and is assigning these soldiers menial tasks instead of allowing them to defend our country. This religious discrimination must stop.""
The federal court ruled in January that the Navy ""merely rubber stamps each denial"" of COVID vaccine Religious Accommodation Requests, which the judge said was unconstitutional.
""Our nation asks the men and women in our military to serve, suffer, and sacrifice,"" Judge Reed O'Connor wrote in his approval of the preliminary injunction against the vaccine mandate for the 35 plaintiffs. ""But we do not ask them to lay aside their citizenry and give up the very rights they have sworn to protect.""
""There is no COVID-19 exception to the First Amendment,"" the judge said. ""There is no military exclusion from our Constitution.""

On September 24, 2021, the Navy issued “Trident Order #12 –Mandatory Vaccination for COVID-19.” The order specified that “Special Operations Designated Personnel (SEAL and SWCC) refusing to receive recommended vaccines based solely on personal or religious beliefs will still be medically disqualified,” court documents revealed.
This order meant that SEALs were designated as ""non-deployable"" if they submitted religious accommodation requests exempting them from the COVID vaccine. All special warfare forces were initially expected to come into compliance with the vaccine mandate by the middle of October 2021.
The order was put on hold due to a preliminary injunction that was affirmed by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in February 2022.
Fox News reports that a new filing in the lawsuit shows the Navy quietly reversed Trident Order #12 on May 22, 2022. A communication order was sent by the Navy on May 23 stating, ""This order rescinds reference A."" ""Ref A"" was referred to as ""Trident Order #12 on COVID-19 Vaccinations.""
Fox News Digital reached out to the Navy for clarification on whether the Navy replaced the order or why Trident Order #12 was being rescinded. ""The Navy does not comment on ongoing litigation,"" a Navy spokesperson responded.
Filings also show that the legal team representing the SEALs only became aware of the recession on September 1.
""To the best of counsel’s knowledge, Trident Order #12 was not replaced. As the Court will recall, Trident Order #12 stated that SEALs who are unvaccinated due to religious beliefs are medically disqualified, though SEALs who are unvaccinated due to medical reasons are not automatically disqualified. Trident Order #12 also implemented the COVID-19 vaccine mandate at the command level for Naval Special Warfare forces, setting a deadline of compliance for October 17, 2021,"" the SEALs' legal team wrote.
The 35 SEALs involved in the lawsuit are being represented by First Liberty Institute and Hacker Stephens LLP.
First Liberty's senior counsel and director of military affairs, Mike Berry, told Fox News Digital, ""Now that the Navy has rescinded this unlawful order, the only reason it won't allow our SEALs to get back to doing their jobs is because of their religious beliefs.""",en,Navy rescinds punishments for SEALs seeking religious exemptions to COVID vaccine,RIGHT,,,,
249,vox.com,https://www.vox.com/22965738/supreme-court-navy-seals-vaccine-covid-joe-biden-commander-mandate,"The United States Navy requires nearly all of its uniformed personnel to be vaccinated against Covid-19. Well over 99 percent of active-duty US sailors have complied with this requirement, leaving only a handful who refuse to obey a direct order.
Yet, rather than facing the consequences that typically face a service member who defies a lawful order from a superior, several Navy personnel who didn’t want the vaccine found Republican judges willing to exempt them from the Navy’s policy. The result is a pitched legal fight over just who is in command of the military: President Joe Biden and the array of civilian officials and military officers who answer to him as commander-in-chief, or a judiciary dominated by Republicans.
Last January, Judge Reed O’Connor, a former GOP Capitol Hill staffer known for his failed attempts to repeal Obamacare and to undermine marriage rights for same-sex couples, ruled in favor of 35 Naval special warfare personnel, 26 of whom are SEALs, who sought a religious exemption from the vaccination policy. Then, in late February, an especially right-wing panel of the conservative United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit refused to stay O’Connor’s decision. This first case is called U.S. Navy SEALs 1-26 v. Biden.
In mid-February, meanwhile, Judge Steven Merryday, a George H.W. Bush appointee, granted similar relief to two officers who claim that their religion requires them to defy the order to get vaccinated. That case is called Navy SEAL 1 v. Austin.
These decisions are egregiously wrong under current law. As the Supreme Court held in Goldman v. Weinberger (1986), “the essence of military service ‘is the subordination of the desires and interests of the individual to the needs of the service.’” Accordingly, the Court has consistently called upon judges to defer to military commanders, and ultimately to elected officials charged with overseeing the military, in cases impacting military readiness.
And, lest there be any doubt, O’Connor’s and Merryday’s decisions are already undermining US national security. None of the Navy personnel in the suits have been vaccinated while waiting for their cases to play out. And Merryday issued an excessively broad order forbidding the Navy from taking “any adverse or retaliatory action ... in conjunction with” the plaintiffs’ requests for religious exemptions.
As Slate’s Mark Joseph Stern reports, one of these two plaintiffs is the commander of a $1.8 billion warship. The Navy wants to remove this officer from his command due to a pattern of insubordination, disregard for the safety of men and women under his command, and dishonesty toward his superiors, including meeting in person with dozens of other Navy personnel while he was infected with Covid-19.
That has led to a standoff between military commanders, who refuse to deploy this officer’s ship until he is removed from command, and Judge Merryday, who insists that nothing can be done to its insubordinate commander. For the time being, that means that a 10,000-ton destroyer and the 320 Naval personnel who work on that vessel are, in the administration’s words, “indefinitely sideline[d].”
The Biden administration formally asked the Court to issue a partial stay of O’Connor’s decision on Monday, asking the justices to block O’Connor’s order to the extent that it “usurps the Navy’s authority to decide which service members should be deployed” on which missions. And it is likely that the Supreme Court will eventually step in and reverse O’Connor and Merryday.
The Court recently upheld a federal rule requiring most health care workers to get vaccinated, and health care workers, unlike members of the military, do not literally sign away their right to refuse a direct order. The Court has also fairly consistently turned away health care workers seeking religious exemptions from vaccine mandates.
But until someone provides adult supervision to O’Connor and Merryday, these two Republican judges will continue to behave as if they, and not President Biden, sit at the apex of the military’s chain of command.
O’Connor’s and Merryday’s orders undermine national security
In the past, the Supreme Court has been crystal clear that judges are not supposed to interfere with the military’s judgments about which service members should be deployed on which missions. As the Court held in Gilligan v. Morgan (1973), “it is difficult to conceive of an area of governmental activity in which the courts have less competence” than “the complex, subtle, and professional decisions as to the composition, training, equipping, and control of a military force.”
The Navy’s senior commanders, moreover, have been equally clear that O’Connor’s and Merryday’s orders undermine national security.
Consider, for example, a statement from Capt. Frank Brandon, the direct superior of the insubordinate destroyer commander (the destroyer commander is not identified by name in court filings). According to Capt. Brandon, this commander reported to work for two days while he was experiencing Covid-19 symptoms, and even spoke at a briefing attended by 50-60 other Navy personnel. Yet he didn’t even get tested for Covid-19 until Brandon ordered him to do so. Then the commander tested positive.
Similarly, Brandon says that this commander “intentionally deceived me” regarding where he would travel when he took leave from his ship.
Capt. Brandon’s statement is supplemented by another from Vice Admiral Daniel Dwyer, commander of the Navy’s Second Fleet, who says that “under no circumstances would the Navy typically deploy a commander in an operational capacity with whom his or her superior officers have such reservations.” But, thanks to Judge Merryday’s order, neither Brandon nor Dwyer can remove this insubordinate officer from command.
Or consider the words of Adm. William Lescher, the Navy’s second-highest uniformed officer in the Navy, regarding why O’Connor’s order is particularly harmful to military readiness.
Among other things, Lescher explains that many Navy vessels have only limited medical personnel and health care facilities. So, if a member of the ship’s crew becomes seriously ill, that “would require a return to port or an emergency medical evacuation by helicopter” — potentially forcing the entire ship to accommodate one unvaccinated service member.
Special forces personnel, moreover, often deploy in very small units, so one member becoming sick can be a big blow to the team. And, the Navy argued, special operations “are often conducted in hostile, austere or diplomatically sensitive environments” where a severely ill service member might not be able to obtain local medical care and may need to be evacuated by the Navy — an operation that is itself dangerous and that could force the sick service member’s fellow sailors to risk their lives on his or her behalf.
For these reasons, the Navy typically disqualifies personnel with fairly minor health risks from special warfare duties altogether. As the Justice Department explains in its brief, “the long list of disqualifying conditions includes, for example, certain forms of sleep apnea, severe allergies, dental issues requiring frequent care, and any condition requiring frequent medication.”
And yet, O’Connor’s order forces the Navy to deploy special operations personnel that the military has determined are medically unsuitable for such work. According to the Justice Department, O’Connor’s order forced the Navy to send one of the plaintiffs “to Hawaii for duty on a submarine against its military judgment.”
O’Connor’s and Merryday’s orders are egregiously wrong
Ordinarily, when someone claims that the federal government has burdened their religious beliefs, they may sue the government under a statute known as the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), which provides that the federal government may not “substantially burden a person’s exercise of religion” unless it does so “in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest” and uses the “least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.”
The Biden administration persuasively argues in its brief that preventing the spread of Covid-19 and ensuring military readiness are both compelling interests, and that a vaccine mandate is the least restrictive way of achieving these goals. But it really shouldn’t even need to make this argument, because the Court has repeatedly held that judges should be exceedingly reluctant to question the military’s decisions regarding its personnel.
The Court has held that judges should defer to the military even when such deference limits the constitutional rights of potential service members. Ordinarily, for example, the Court has held that “a party seeking to uphold government action based on sex must establish an ‘exceedingly persuasive justification’ for the classification.” In Rostker v. Goldberg (1981), however, the Court permitted the Selective Service System to discriminate against men by requiring them, and not women, to register for the draft.
In fact, the Court has specifically held that judges should defer to the military when a service member claims that their religious liberties are burdened by an order from a superior. That was the holding of Goldman, which held that a Jewish officer was not exempt from an Air Force regulation prohibiting him from wearing a yarmulke, the traditional Jewish skullcap, while he was indoors.
“Our review of military regulations challenged on First Amendment grounds is far more deferential than constitutional review of similar laws or regulations designed for civilian society,” the Court explained in Goldman, adding that granting an exemption would undermine service members’ “habit of immediate compliance with military procedures and orders” — a habit that “must be virtually reflex with no time for debate or reflection.”
In fairness, Goldman was decided nearly four decades ago, and the Court’s current majority is far more sympathetic to the concerns of religious objectors than the justices who sat in the 1980s. And generally, the Court’s deference to the executive branch on national security might merit some reevaluation. But the Court concluded as recently as 2018 that judges should defer to the president on matters of national security, even when religious liberty is at stake.
That was the holding of Trump v. Hawaii (2018), which upheld former President Donald Trump’s policy preventing people from several predominantly Muslim nations from entering the United States. “‘Any rule of constitutional law that would inhibit the flexibility’ of the President ‘to respond to changing world conditions,’” the Court explained in Hawaii, “‘should be adopted only with the greatest caution,’ and our inquiry into matters of entry and national security is highly constrained.”
All of which is a long way of saying that O’Connor’s and Merryday’s decisions have no basis in law.
Something needs to be done to prevent rogue judges from issuing lawless orders that bind the entire country
It is likely, for a variety of reasons, that the Supreme Court will not tolerate O’Connor’s and Merryday’s orders. Though the Court 6-3 Republican majority struck down a Biden administration rule requiring most workers to get vaccinated, it has otherwise shown a degree of moderation in vaccination cases. Among other things, the Court has consistently rejected requests from religious objectors claiming that their faith entitles them to remain unvaccinated, despite a state or federal policy requiring vaccination.
Similarly, while the Court’s current majority appears eager to rewrite many longstanding legal doctrines, they’ve given few outward signs that they will overrule the many previous Court decisions warning judges not to micromanage the military.
But O’Connor’s and Merryday’s orders highlight a pervasive problem within the judiciary. It is too easy for litigants to shop around for sympathetic judges who are willing to issue orders that most judges would conclude are lawless. And it takes far too long for the Biden administration to secure an order from a higher court overturning these rogue judges’ decisions.
Moreover, while the Supreme Court may step in to halt truly egregious decisions by conservative judges like O’Connor and Merryday, the fact that the Court is dominated by movement conservatives creates a partisan imbalance. When Republican judges issue dubious orders blocking Democratic policies, the Court often lets those orders remain in effect for months — if not forever. When lower court judges block Republican policies, by contrast, the Roberts Court frequently intervenes with great alacrity.
Oddly enough, archconservative Justice Neil Gorsuch offered one of the most persuasive arguments against allowing a single federal judge to block a federal policy on a nationwide basis in 2020.
“There are currently more than 1,000 active and senior district court judges, sitting across 94 judicial districts, and subject to review in 12 regional courts of appeal,” Gorsuch wrote. If every one of these judges can halt any federal policy, he added, then “the government’s hope of implementing any new policy could face the long odds of a straight sweep, parlaying a 94-to-0 win in the district courts into a 12-to-0 victory in the courts of appeal.”
Hundreds of judges could potentially uphold a policy, but if the government is handed “a single loss,” then “the policy goes on ice.”
It’s unclear whether Gorsuch is still bothered by these kinds of single-judge, nationwide injunctions now that a Democrat is in the White House. But if Gorsuch and others like him want to prevent judges like O’Connor and Merryday from declaring themselves commander-in-chief, there’s a fairly straightforward policy solution.
As law professor Steven Vladeck writes, Congress or the Court could require all lawsuits seeking to block a federal policy to be heard by a three-judge panel, rather than by a single judge. And the government could also gain the power to transfer these cases to a federal court in DC — thus preventing plaintiffs from shopping around for sympathetic judges.
Any lawsuit seeking to block a federal policy on its face should have to be heard by a three-judge district court. And the federal government should have the right to transfer any such suit to the D.C. district court.
Otherwise, we’re in for decades of government by injunctions. — Steve Vladeck (@steve_vladeck) March 5, 2022
Such a policy could be implemented by Congress, but it could also potentially be implemented by the justices themselves.

Liberty Counsel sued on behalf of military plaintiffs’ whose COVID-19 religious exemptions were denied, and as a result faced discharge, court martial, or termination.

Judge Steven Merryday last week granted a temporary restraining order for two plaintiffs, a U.S. Marine Corps lieutenant colonel and a U.S. Navy captain and Command Surface Warfare officer, as a result of Liberty Counsel’s request for an emergency injunction. Both were facing imminent removal from their positions of command, and ultimate discharge from the military.

As part of the ongoing litigation process, Merryday ordered each branch of the military to file a detailed report every two weeks on the number of COVID-19 religious exemptions filed and granted. The latest filings received by the court as of Feb. 4 reveal that out of 24,818 religious exemption requests the four branches received, four were granted. At least two of the four were granted to service members who were already leaving the military, Liberty Counsel says.

While religious exemptions continued to be denied, 4,146 medical exemptions were granted.

Liberty Counsel is asking the judge to extend the emergency injunction and grant injunctions for all plaintiffs at a hearing scheduled for Thursday. Other military class members have also received final denials to their appeals from their initial requests, and their “irreversible vaccinate-or-separate choices are imminent,” Liberty Counsel said.

The Orlando-based religious freedom organization maintains the Biden administration and the Department of Defense “have no legal right to deny the religious exemptions and accommodations from the COVID shots for the military. Our service members need immediate relief from these mandates.”

In his 10-page order granting the emergency injunction, Merryday said he was searching in vain for any justification for the military branches’ refusal to grant accommodations.

“The record in this action establishes that the two service members are very likely to prevail on their claim that their respective branch of the military has wrongfully denied a religious exemption from COVID-19 vaccination,” he wrote. “The record creates a strong inference that the services are discriminatorily and systematically denying religious exemptions without a meaningful and fair hearing and without the showing required under RFRA (while simultaneously granting medical exemptions and permitting unvaccinated persons to continue in service without adverse consequence).

“One struggles to imagine a wholesome and lawful explanation for the results evidenced in this record,” he added. “The military is well aware of the frailty of their arguments in defense of their practices. Those arguments both procedural and substantive, are rejected in an action that is distinctively parallel to this action. … Rejection on the same or a more encompassing basis is likely in this action (especially if the conduct of the military continues along the present lines).”

He notes that the two service members requesting an immediate injunction faced “either (1) a most-likely-unlawful deprivation of their accumulated status and standing in the United States military, as well as prospective advancement and benefits, or (2) deprivation of their constitutional and statutory rights to Free Exercise and the statutory right to receive a religious exemption unless the military can meet the statutory burden of proof, which the military has not and likely cannot. On the other hand, the military faces a trivial, if any, prospect of material injury …”

Merryday’s ruling was “a great victory for religious freedom,” Liberty Counsel Founder and Chairman Mat Staver said. “It is shameful how the military is treating these honorable service members. The military under the Biden administration is denying every religious exemption request while granting medical exemptions. The abuse and pressure being placed upon these military members is unconscionable and must stop.”

The lawsuit was filed after Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin issued a memo directing ""the Secretaries of the Military Departments to immediately begin full vaccination of all members of the Armed Forces under DoD authority on active duty or in the Ready Reserve, including the National Guard, who are not fully vaccinated against COVID-19.""

The directive states, ""Mandatory vaccination against COVID-19 will only use COVID-19 vaccines that receive full licensure from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), in accordance with FDA-approved labeling and guidance.""

Despite claims made by the FDA, Liberty Counsel maintains there is currently no FDA-approved COVID-19 shot available anywhere in the U.S. All shots being administered are only through emergency use authorization, which according to federal law requires informed consent and that EUA drugs be optional, not mandatory.",en,Liberty Counsel: Military continues to deny religious exemptions as Navy SEALs head to court,RIGHT-CENTER,MOSTLY FACTUAL,,,

Alito wrote that his colleagues were “rubberstamping the Government’s request.” “These individuals appear to have been treated shabbily by the Navy, and the Court brushes all that aside,” Alito wrote.
A federal judge in Texas in January issued a preliminary injunction barring the Navy from acting against the sailors. The Biden administration said it was not asking the Supreme Court to block parts of the lower court order barring the sailors from being disciplined or discharged but only the requirement that their assignments be made without considering their vaccination status. That requirement posed “intolerable risks to safety and mission success,” the administration had argued.
“Navy personnel routinely operate for extended periods of time in confined spaces that are ripe breeding grounds for respiratory illnesses, where mitigation measures such as distancing are impractical or impossible. A SEAL who falls ill not only cannot complete his or her own mission, but risks infecting others as well, particularly in close quarters, including on submarines,” Biden administration lawyers wrote.
Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin last year made vaccinations mandatory for service members. Navy guidelines allow for exemptions to the vaccine requirement on religious and other grounds, including medical reasons and if a service member is about to leave the Navy. The Biden administration says the Navy has received more than 4,000 requests for religious exemptions, but it said that as of the start of February only about 80 had been fully adjudicated. It said one religious exemption had been granted.
Lawyers for the group of sailors that sued had argued that the Navy had granted hundreds of non-religious exemptions. They said that in asking the high court to allow vaccine status to be considered, the Navy was seeking “license to engage in hostile tactics designed to coerce plaintiffs into disregarding their religious beliefs.”
Lower courts had denied the Biden administration’s plea to be allowed to consider vaccination status. That includes a federal judge in Texas, Reed O’Connor, who was nominated by former President George W. Bush, and a three-judge panel of the 5th U.S Circuit Court of Appeals.

U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) Secretary Lloyd Austin on Monday asked the U.S. Supreme Court to block a lower court order which allowed for the deployment of Navy SEALs who have refused the vaccine for religious reasons.
NBC News reported that Austin, in the emergency court filing, stated that the lower court’s order “usurps the Navy’s authority to decide when servicemembers should be deployed to execute some of the military’s most sensitive and dangerous missions.”
Durant, however, asserted that the Pentagon’s attempt to force vaccination upon Navy SEALs is akin to a “witch hunt.” The Senate candidate stated that the coronavirus’ severity had diluted into a variant that “is no worse than the flu.”
“With Russia, China and Iran threatening America and our allies across the world, Joe Biden’s Pentagon is focused on a witch hunt against members of our military because they won’t get vaccinated against a virus that at this point, is no worse than the flu,” lamented Durant. “These are some of the greatest warriors on Earth, who are in top shape and great health. The Pentagon should focus on ensuring they’re prepared and ready to defend our country, not about forcing vaccine mandates on healthy individuals.”
According to Durant, the Pentagon’s priorities should emphasize readiness rather than mandated COVID-19 vaccination.
“This is the problem with Washington: from the Pentagon to Capitol Hill, career politicians and bureaucrats’ priorities are out of whack,” Durant added. “These men and women signed up to serve our country. Instead of taking them to court over a flu vaccine, the military should focus on readiness issues that matter.”

Navy SEAL Candidate Dies, 2nd Hospitalized After ‘Hell Week’
One Navy SEAL candidate died and a second was hospitalized after they completed the “Hell Week” that ends the first phase of assessment of the special operations force candidates.
Naval Special Warfare Command said in a statement to news outlets on Feb. 4 that the SEAL candidate’s cause of death is not yet known. The injured candidate is in stable condition at the Naval Medical Center San Diego, officials said.
The Navy confirmed on Sunday that 24-year-old Seaman Kyle Mullen died at Sharp Coronado Hospital in California on Friday.
“We extend our deepest sympathies to Seaman Mullen’s family for their loss,” Rear Admiral H.W. Howard III said in the statement. “We are extending every form of support we can to the Mullen family and Kyle’s BUD/S classmates,” Howard added.
The trainees “were not actively training when they reported symptoms and were transported to receive emergency care,” the Navy said.
“My prayers are with the family and loved ones of the deceased during this very difficult time, and I wish for a full recovery of the other candidate reported injured yesterday,” House Rep. Scott Peters (D-Calif.) said in a statement, local media reported.
He added: “These courageous, talented sailors were on their way to becoming some of our country’s most elite military personnel. We must find out what transpired so we can do whatever we can to keep others safe. In the days and weeks ahead, I look forward to learning more as the Navy conducts a thorough investigation.”
The last SEAL candidate to die during the assessment phase before the death on Feb. 4 was in 2016. James Derek Lovelace, 21, was treading water with his gear in a massive pool when an instructor pushed him underwater at least twice.
The San Diego County Medical Examiner initially ruled his death a homicide. The Navy said in 2017 that it would not pursue criminal charges after an investigation was carried out into Lovelace’s death.
An autopsy revealed that Lovelace had an enlarged heart and other health issues that may have contributed to his death.
Hell Week, which refers to a portion of the first part of SEAL training, “consists of 5 1/2 days of cold, wet, brutally difficult operational training on fewer than four hours of sleep,” according to a NavySeals website. “Hell Week tests physical endurance, mental toughness, pain and cold tolerance, teamwork, attitude, and your ability to perform work under high physical and mental stress, and sleep deprivation.”
“On average, only 25 percent of SEAL candidates make it through Hell Week, the toughest training in the U.S. Military,” it says.
“It is a miserable time, it is well-named,” said Paul Anderson, a retired Navy Seal Chief, FOX5 reported. “It’s a gut check. You get approximately four hours of sleep the whole week. You are constantly doing physical evolutions whether it’s physical obstacles, going in and out of the surf zone with your boats, running, you are constantly wet and you are always sandy.”
The Naval Special Warfare Command has launched an investigation into the death, said the military.

Austin has requested the U.S. Supreme Court stay (i.e., block) a lower court decision favoring 35 members of the Naval Special Warfare Command, including 26 Navy SEALs, who face punishment and discharge from the military for objecting – on religious grounds – to receiving a required COVID-19 vaccine.
The Secretary’s application to Justice Samuel Alito “seeks relief from a preliminary injunction that usurps the Navy’s authority to decide which servicemembers should be deployed to execute some of the military’s most sensitive and dangerous missions.”
The application asserts that the lower courts’ rulings are jeopardizing missions.
“The court’s preliminary injunction not only prohibits the Navy from applying the COVID-19 vaccination requirement to respondents, but also requires the Navy to assign and deploy them without regard to their lack of vaccinations notwithstanding military leaders’ judgment that doing so poses intolerable risks to safety and mission success.”
The Secretary argues that Navy SEALs operate under extreme conditions. They can be called on to deploy anywhere in the world on short notice and operate in small teams and in close quarters for extended periods of time. And they must, according to Secretary Austin, be “as physically and medically prepared as possible.”
But as the 5th Circuit pointed out when it refused to block a similar request from the Navy just recently, the government is not being totally honest in making that argument.
“The Navy has granted hundreds of medical exemptions from vaccination requirements, allowing those service members to seek medical waivers and become deployable,” the three-judge panel wrote on February 28. “But it has not accommodated any religious objection to any vaccine in seven years, preventing those seeking such accommodations from even being considered for medical waivers.”
In other words, if the Navy has handed down hundreds of medical waivers but no religious waivers, the issue is really about government hostility toward religion, not military readiness.
First Liberty Institute represents the Navy SEALs.
“Both [Federal District Court] Judge O’Connor and the Fifth Circuit got it right; there is no Covid exception to our Constitution. But the Biden Administration appears to be more interested in promoting its harmful agenda than in defending the Constitution,” said Mike Berry, Vice President of External Affairs, Director of Military Affairs, and Senior Counsel for First Liberty Institute, in a press release. “As the Fifth Circuit did last week, the U.S. Supreme Court should reject this latest attempt to punish our clients and make clear, once and for all, that our service members do not forfeit their religious freedom because they are in the military.”
Justice Alito has asked for a response from the 35 servicemembers who brought the case by March 14.
The case is Austin v. U.S. Navy Seals.

592,nbcnews.com,https://nbcnews.com/news/military/navy-seal-trainee-died-hell-week-succumbed-acute-pneumonia-cardiac-arr-rcna51676,"WASHINGTON — A Navy SEAL candidate who died hours after he completed the grueling stretch of training known as Hell Week succumbed to acute pneumonia and cardiac arrest, according to a military investigation obtained by NBC News.
A Naval Special Warfare Command Line of Duty investigation, which was completed last month, found Seaman Kyle Mullen died in the line of duty, not because of his own misconduct.
But the Armed Forces Medical Examiner’s autopsy report, which is included in the investigative report, also found that when Mullen died in February, his heart was more than twice the normal size. An electrocardiogram of his heart nine months earlier had found no abnormalities, according to the Navy’s investigation.
Medical experts who reviewed his case for the investigation were split over whether his enlarged heart was a side effect of the arduous training or possibly due to the use of performance enhancing drugs, or PEDs, after drug paraphernalia were found among his possessions.
When he died on Feb. 4, Mullen had just completed the fourth week of Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL (BUD/S) training, commonly known as Hell Week. Beginning on a Sunday afternoon and ending Friday morning, Hell Week exposes candidates to extreme stress to simulate intense combat situations, including training in harsh environments, long periods of swimming in punishing cold water and sleep deprivation.
Training to be a Navy SEAL is punishing, and Hell Week is among its toughest parts. Of the roughly 1,500 students who enter BUD/S training every year, only about 250 complete it, according to the Navy.
It was Mullen’s second attempt to finish the BUD/S course after heatstroke derailed his first attempt in summer 2021.
During Hell Week, he had respiratory problems, including fluid in his lungs, coughing and difficulty breathing, rapid weight gain and swelling in his legs, and disorientation, according to the investigation. Medical professionals examined Mullen every day that week, but his symptoms were common among many of the candidates, and, according to witnesses, he declined more medical attention for fear it would exclude him from completing his training.
By the time he successfully completed Hell Week, Mullen had gained 22 pounds from swelling and fluid retention, and he had to return to the barracks in a wheelchair. Witnesses reported that he was coughing and spitting up red-tinged fluids and that by that afternoon he was bloated and gasping for air and that his skin was turning blueish, a witness said.
Several hours later, paramedics found him unresponsive in his barracks. He died at a hospital that evening.
According to multiple witnesses interviewed for the investigation, symptoms like Mullen’s are common among candidates after Hell Week and do not necessarily raise suspicions among fellow sailors. A post-Hell Week brief to students warns “swelling of your extremities is typical” and can last for several days, and it recommends that they elevate their hands and feet. The paramedics who found Mullen were at the barracks responding to another SEAL candidate who was also struggling to breathe.
At least six other students went to a Navy hospital over the four days after Hell Week, according to the investigation.
The Armed Forces Medical Examiner autopsy report did not find performance enhancing drugs contributed to Mullen’s death, but it found his heart weighed 700 grams, more than double the standard for an adult male.
Multiple military medical professionals reviewed the documents about Mullen’s death for the Naval Special Warfare investigation, and while they agreed that he died from acute pneumonia, an enlarged heart and ultimately cardiac arrest, they were split over whether those symptoms caused his ultimate heart failure or were warning signs of his cardiac distress.
Several of the experts noted that use of steroids can cause an enlarged heart. A Navy Bureau of Medicine expert wrote that chronic use of PEDs like recombinant growth hormone and exogenous testosterone can be associated with enlarged heart and that “if [Seaman] Mullen had been using these PEDs, then such use could have contributed to his abnormal heart mass and thickness on autopsy,” adding, “However, it is impossible to know the frequency or duration of PED use by SN Mullen.”
A professional consulted for the investigation said other factors contributing to Mullen’s death included “the use of prohibited performance enhancing drugs (PEDs), possible swimming induced pulmonary edema (SIPE), and the rigorous physical demands of BUD/S Assessment and Selection.”
Mullen’s heart was 64.7% over the upper limit of the range for someone of his age, fitness and build, the report says, and anabolic steroid use is associated with an enlarged heart and sudden cardiac death. Another medical professional says PEDs can contribute to fluid retention and even susceptibility to infection, but that is also in dispute, with a separate assessment calling it “speculative.”
Mullen “was in possession of and suspected of misusing several PEDs,” a medical professional wrote, including Anastrobol, recombinant human growth hormone and testosterone, all of which can be used to increase muscle mass. Drug paraphernalia were among Mullen’s possessions after he died, but it is unclear whether they belonged to him or another candidate, according to multiple people familiar with the investigation.
Multiple witnesses and classmates interviewed for the investigation said they had no direct knowledge that Mullen was using PEDs.
‘Safety concerns’
Mullen’s death and the ensuing investigation have shed new light on the simmering issue of the use of PEDs among elite members of the military, especially during extreme training.
The commander of Naval Education and Training Command is conducting a separate investigation into the circumstances of Mullen’s death, as well as the broader issues it raised, including the use of PEDs. The Navy expects to have some conclusions from the training command by the end of the year, a military official said.
“Our deepest sympathy extends to Seaman Mullen’s family and friends during this difficult time,” Rear Adm. Keith Davids, commander of Naval Special Warfare Command, wrote in a statement. “NSW remains committed to transparency and we welcome the opportunity to review our assessment and selection programs, and help us look for additional ways to improve and prevent this kind of tragedy from happening again.
“Kyle’s death will not be in vain. We have a moral obligation to learn everything we can from Kyle’s tragic death so that we can ensure the safety of all future candidates,” Davids wrote.
Since Mullen’s death, candidates are now tested for PEDs at least five times during training. Just two months after Mullen died, a candidate tested positive for PEDs and was removed from training, according to the Navy.
After Mullen died, Naval Special Warfare also began advanced cardiology screening for all candidates. Of the 656 candidates who have undergone cardiac screening since February, two have been found unfit for full duty because of cardiac issues. Naval Special Warfare also now gives candidates Bicillin to prevent pneumonia, it has extended the post-Hell Week medical observation time, and it is working to expand its authority to test for PEDs.
Naval Special Warfare said “there was enough evidence of PED use within the [training] class to raise safety concerns.” As of Sept. 22, Naval Special Warfare said, it had tested 1,244 personnel for PEDs and then removed 51 people from training because of “safety concerns.”",en,"Navy SEAL trainee who died after Hell Week succumbed to acute pneumonia and cardiac arrest, report says",LEFT-CENTER,HIGH,HIGH CREDIBILITY,,
3687,nbcnews.com,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/pentagon-asks-supreme-court-block-order-deployment-seals-refuse-covid-rcna19036,"WASHINGTON — Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin asked the Supreme Court on Monday to block part of a lower court order that prevents the Navy from restricting the deployment of Navy SEALs who refuse to get a Covid vaccine.
The order “usurps the Navy’s authority to decide when servicemembers should be deployed to execute some of the military’s most sensitive and dangerous missions,” Austin said in the emergency court filing.
A federal judge in Texas ruled in early January that the Navy must allow members of the elite special operations community to opt out of the vaccine requirement if they have religious objections. His order also forbids their commanders from making any changes to their military assignments based on their refusal to be vaccinated. It’s the second part of the order that Austin asked the Supreme Court to block.
Austin said the order requires the Navy “to assign and deploy them without regard to their lack of vaccinations, notwithstanding military leaders’ judgment that doing so poses intolerable risks to safety and mission success.”
The Navy has already sent one member of a SEAL team to a mission on a submarine, against the wishes of commanders, Austin said. He called the lower court order an “extraordinary and unprecedented intrusion into core military affairs” that has no precedent in American history.
Adm. William K. Lescher, vice chief of naval operations, has concluded that the illness of even one member of a small SEAL team due to Covid-19 could compromise the mission, according to court filings.
U.S. District Judge Reed O’Connor issued the order on Jan. 3 in a lawsuit brought by 35 Navy seals who said the mandatory vaccination policy violated their religious freedom.
“The Navy provides a religious accommodation process, but by all accounts, it is theater,"" O’Connor wrote. ""The Navy has not granted a religious exemption to any vaccine in recent memory. It merely rubber stamps each denial.”
On Feb. 28, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals declined to block O’Connor’s order, leading to Monday’s appeal by the government.

155,nbcnews.com,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/supreme-court-blocks-order-deployment-seals-refuse-covid-vaccine-rcna19885,"WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Friday blocked a lower court order that prevented the Navy from restricting the deployment of Navy SEALs who refuse to get a Covid vaccination.
Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin had urged the court to remedy what he called “an extraordinary and unprecedented intrusion into core military affairs” that had no precedent in American history.
A federal judge in Texas ruled in early January that the Navy must allow members of the elite special operations community to opt out of the vaccination requirement if they had religious objections. But the judge's order went further, forbidding commanders to make any changes to their military assignments based on a refusal to be vaccinated.
On Friday, the Supreme Court put the judge’s order on hold “insofar as its precludes the Navy from making deployment, assignment, and other operational decisions.” That frees up the Navy to issue deployment orders based on Covid vaccination status.
Three justices — Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch — said they would have denied the Navy’s request.
In a separate dissenting opinion for himself and Gorsuch, Alito said the court rubber stamped the Navy’s request, doing “a great injustice” to the sailors.
“These individuals appear to have been treated shabbily by the Navy,” Alito said.
Justice Brett Kavanaugh said he agreed with the Supreme Court’s Friday order. Under the Constitution, he said, “the President of the United States, not any federal judge, is the Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces.” The judge in this case improperly inserted himself into the military chain of command, Kavanaugh said.
Austin said the restriction usurped the Navy’s authority to decide when servicemembers should be deployed to carry out some of the military’s most sensitive and dangerous missions. It required commanders to make assignments for servicemembers “without regard to their lack of vaccinations, notwithstanding military leaders’ judgment that doing so poses intolerable risks to safety and mission success.”
The Navy has already sent one member of a SEAL team to a mission on a submarine against the wishes of commanders, the Pentagon said.
U.S. District Court Judge Reed O’Connor issued the order on Jan. 3 in a lawsuit brought by 35 Navy Special Warfare servicemembers, including 26 SEALs, who said the mandatory vaccination policy violated their religious freedom. “The Navy provides a religious accommodation process, but by all accounts, it is theater. The Navy has not granted a religious exemption to any vaccine in recent memory. It merely rubber stamps each denial,” he wrote.
On Feb. 28, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit declined to block O’Connor’s order.
By granting the Navy’s request to block the order, the Supreme Court likely doomed the case of a Navy officer who commands a guided missile destroyer. He brought a similar court challenge to the vaccination requirement, and U.S. District Court judge Steven Merryday of Florida, like O’Connor, found the vaccination order to be a violation of religious freedom and barred the Navy from taking any adverse action against the officer.
Because the Navy considers the officer to be a threat to the health of the crew, it blocked the deployment of the ship, with its crew of 320.
The Supreme Court has traditionally been highly deferential to military judgments about deployments. It said in a 1973 case that it is difficult to conceive of an area of governmental activity in which the courts have less competence than “the complex, subtle, and professional decisions as to the composition, training, equipping, and control of a force.”
In a 1986 case, the court said the essence of military service “is the subordination of the desires and interests of the individual to the needs of the service.”",en,"Supreme Court blocks lower court ruling on Navy SEALs and Covid vaccinations, in win for Pentagon",LEFT-CENTER,HIGH,HIGH CREDIBILITY,,
3915,pbs.org,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/federal-judge-blocks-navy-from-acting-against-35-covid-vaccine-refusers,"WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge in Texas has granted a preliminary injunction stopping the Navy from acting against 35 sailors for refusing on religious grounds to comply with an order to get vaccinated against COVID-19.
The injunction is a new challenge to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin’s decision to make vaccinations mandatory for all members of the military. The vaccination requirement allows for exemptions on religious and other grounds, but none of the thousands of requests for religious waivers so far have been granted.
There was no indication that the order would affect service members beyond the 35 sailors who sued Austin and the Navy. The Pentagon had no immediate response to a request for comment.
Well over 90 percent of the military has been fully vaccinated against COVID-19, including at least 98.5 percent of active and reserve members of the Navy. Austin asserts that vaccines are a valid and necessary medical requirement to protect service members and their families and ensure the combat readiness of the force.
In his decision Monday, U.S. District Judge Reed O’Connor wrote that the Navy’s process for considering a sailor’s request for a religious exemption is flawed and amounts to “theater.”
O’Connor, who was appointed by President George W. Bush, wrote that the group of 35 sailors who sued the government in November and sought a preliminary injunction against the Navy have a right on religious and First Amendment grounds to refuse the vaccination order.
“The Navy servicemembers in this case seek to vindicate the very freedoms they have sacrificed so much to protect,” O’Connor wrote. “The COVID-19 pandemic provides the government no license to abrogate those freedoms. There is no COVID-19 exception to the First Amendment. There is no military exclusion from our Constitution.”

The O’Connor injunction was first reported by The Washington Post.
Without commenting on the case in Texas, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby last month defended the validity of the military service’s processes for considering religious exemptions.
“Each exemption asked for on religious grounds is evaluated by a chaplain, by a chain of command, by medical experts and is given quite a lot of thought, and they’re all decided case by case individually,” he said Dec. 21.
In his decision in favor of the injunction sought by the 35 Navy sailors, O’Connor wrote that they objected to being vaccinated on four grounds: “opposition to abortion and the use of aborted fetal cell lines in development of the vaccine; belief that modifying one’s body is an affront to the Creator; divine instruction not to receive the vaccine, and opposition to injecting trace amounts of animal cells into one’s body.”
“Plaintiffs’ beliefs about the vaccine are undisputedly sincere, and it is not the role of this court to determine their truthfulness or accuracy,” the judge wrote.
The sailors who sued are members of the Naval Special Warfare Command, including SEALs. The suit was filed by First Liberty Institute, a nonprofit that focuses on defending religious liberty.
In the early stages of the pandemic, the Navy struggled with one particularly critical COVID-19 outbreak. Hundreds of sailors aboard the USS Theodore Roosevelt aircraft carrier were infected, starting in late March while on a deployment to Vietnam and elsewhere in Asia. The ship was taken out of operation at Guam, its commanding officer was relieved of duty and the crisis led to the resignation of acting Navy Secretary Thomas Modly.
Since then, the Navy and other services have managed to avoid major disruptions. In December, officials said about two dozen sailors on board the USS Milwaukee, or roughly 25 percent of the ship’s crew, had tested positive for COVID-19, keeping the vessel sidelined in port at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay in Cuba. On Monday, the Navy announced that the ship had returned to sea.

Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt announced that his office and 21 other states filed an amicus brief in U.S. Navy Seals v. Biden, opposing the Biden Administration’s COVID-19 vaccine mandate on members of the military. The brief asserts that the refusal to grant religious exemptions from the COVID-19 vaccine to members of the United States Navy violates the right to religious liberty.
“I joined an amicus brief that supports the Navy Seals’ religious freedom and opposes the continued overreach of the Biden Administration,” said Attorney General Schmitt. “My Office has been a national leader in the fight against tyrannical COVID-19 policies, especially as the first state to file suit to halt the OSHA vaccine mandate on private businesses. With this brief, we’re continuing this critically important fight against government overreach at every level.”
The brief states, “In the past year, courts have recognized the overreaching and flawed claims of legal authority underlying the Administration’s response [to COVID-19], the tension between its policies and the facts, and its inconsistent statements and actions that undercut its claims of good faith.” Therefore, the states assert, it is clear that the typical deference given to military authorities does not apply in this case.
Joining Missouri in filing the amicus brief are Mississippi, Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wyoming.
